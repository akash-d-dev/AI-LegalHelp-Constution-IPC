Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is g uilty of murder, although the blow might not have been \nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is \nlabouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in  the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of \nhealth, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such \nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cau se the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \nZ dies in consequence.

This is murder, \ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and th e death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in  \ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provoc ation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z.
