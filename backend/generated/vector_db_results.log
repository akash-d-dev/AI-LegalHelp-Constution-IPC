Explanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury 
shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and ski lful treatment 
the death might have been prevented. 
Explanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it ma y 
amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought 
forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. 
300. Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by 
which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or— 
2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely 
to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or— 
3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury 
intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— 
4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous t hat it must, in all 
probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and comm its such act without 
any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. 
Illustrations 
(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. 
(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is like ly to cause his death, strikes him with the intention 
of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is g uilty of murder, although the blow might not have been 
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is 
labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in  the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of 
health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such 
bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. 
(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cau se the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. 
Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. 
(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although  
he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. 
Exception 1 .—When culpable homicide is not murder .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the 
offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, c auses the death 
of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. 
The above exception is subject to the following provisos:— 
First.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excus e for 
killing or doing harm to any person. 
Secondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public  
servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. 
Thirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of 
private defence. 
Explanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from 
amounting to murder is a question of fact. 
Illustrations 
(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, 
inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and th e death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in  
doing an act caused by the provocation. 
(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provoc ation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing 
himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable 
homicide.

giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. 
(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a by stander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and 
to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only 
culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. 
Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of t he 
right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to h im by law and causes the 
death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without prem editation, and 
without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. 
Illustration 
Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievo us hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the 
assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other m eans prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has 
not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. 
Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding  a 
public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and 
causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessar y for the due 
discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the perso n whose death is 
caused. 
Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation i n a sudden 
fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having t aken undue 
advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. 
Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first 
assault. 
Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above 
the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. 
Illustration 
A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years o f age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's 
youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.
