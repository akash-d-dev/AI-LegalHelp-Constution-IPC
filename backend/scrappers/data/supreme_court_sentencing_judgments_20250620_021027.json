The position is reversed with the passing of the new Codeof 1973 where Section 354(3)of the Criminal Procedure Coderequires Special reasons to be given for awardingsentenceof death. This has made the deathsentenceas an exception and life imprisonment a rule. We are left in dark about the reasons for committing themurderof Mst. Somoti.

In these circumstances, we cannot hold that themurderwas a brutal one which calls for the extremepenalty of death, In view of these circumstances, while maintaining the conviction of Badri under Sections 302 and 307, Indian Penal Code, we think it proper to reduce the deathpenalty to one of life imprisonment under Section 302, Indian Penal Code.

In view of these facts, the Supreme Courtheld that this was not a case of rarest of rare and death penalty was not warranted, hence thesentenceof death was commuted tolifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtfelt that it was not a fit case to award a deathsentencebut the Supreme Courtobserved that asentenceoflifeimprisonment which, subject to remission, normally works out to a term of 14 years would be grossly disproportionate and inadequate. The Supreme Courtfurther observed that in such case, thecourt's option is limited only to two punishments, one asentenceofimprisonment, for all intents and purposes, of not more than 14 years and the other death, in which case the Courtmay feel tempted and find itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty. Such a course would indeed be disastrous.

    "text": "State Of Uttarakhand vs Yusuf Alias Sonu on 2 May, 2024 28. Keeping in view the abovse prayer, the appeal qua merit is dismissed, and this Courtproceeds to examine the issue of commuting deathsentencetoimprisonment forlife.29. In 1973, the Supreme Courtin the case of Jagmohan Singh Vs State of U. P.(1973) 1 S C C 20, examined the question whether deathsentenceawarded by acourtunder Section 302 of Indian Penal Code, 1880 was violative of sub-clause (1) of Article 19 of the Constitution. As per Sub- Section (5) of Section 367 of Criminal Procedure Code, there was a discretion with thecourteither to award capitalsentenceorlifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtheld that Article 19 of the Constitution does not directly deal with the freedom to live. It is not included in the seven freedoms mentioned in that Article. As far as India is concerned, capital punishment cannot be described as unusual because that kind of punishment has been with us from ancient times right up to the present day though the number of offences for which it can be imposed has continuously changed. The framers of our Constitution were well aware of the existence of capital punishment as a permissible punishment under the law. The other Articles in the Constitution, viz., Section 72(1)(c), 72(3),21 and 134 and Sections 401 and 402 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Entries 1 and 2 in List I I I of the Seventh Schedule, all indicate that capitalsentencehas not been regarded per se as unreasonable or not in the public interest.45. The Supreme Courtin B. A. Umesh Vs Union of India and others, Criminal Appeal No. 1892 of 2022 (arising out of S L P ( Crl.) No. 890 of 2022, decided on 04.11.2022) has also examined the issue whether delay in execution of deathsentencecould be a sufficient ground for substituting deathsentencebyimprisonment forlife.46. In the above matter, the Supreme Courtwas examining the case where the execution of deathsentencewas due to the delay which took place in execution of the deathsentencedue to pendency of mercy petition and reference was made to a judgment of Ajay Kumar Pal Vs Union of India and another, 2015 (2) S C C 49. In A. G. Perarivalan Vs Statethrough Superintendent of Police and another, 2022 S C C Online S C 635, a bench of three Judges of Supreme Courthad commuted thesentenceof death tolifein a petition filed under Article 161 of the Constitution keeping in view the fact that the petition remained pending for 2½ years with the Hon'ble Governor, despite recommendation of the State Cabinet for remission of thesentence.50. In the facts of the present case, the judgment of conviction is dated 27.04.2018 and till 2 nd May, 2024, almost six years have gone-by and the Supreme Courtin the case of B. A. Umesh vs. Union of India(supra) has observed that the delay in execution of deathsentencecould be a sufficient ground for substituting deathsentencebyimprisonment forlife. The Supreme Courtreferred to the case of Ajay Kumar Pal vs. Union of India and another 2015 (2) S C C 478, where there was delay of 3 years and 10 months on account of pendency of a mercy petition and this delay was not attributed to the accused. It was sufficient ground to commute the deathsentencetoimprisonment forlife. The Supreme Courtwas examining a case, where a period of two years and three months was taken to dispose of the mercy petition, which was a ground for commuting the deathsentencetoimprisonment forlife.56. Hence, the punishment, which can be awarded to the accused (respondent) under Section 6 of the P O C S O Act read with Section 42, islife, and the punishment under Section 302 of I P C is for death, orimprisonment forlifeand fine. Since the appellant had been punished with death penalty, it is being commuted toimprisonment forlife.57. The issue as regards commuting death penalty toimprisonment forlifewas considered by a three- Judge Bench of the Supreme Courtin Swamy Shraddananda (2) vs. State of Karnataka(2008) 13 S C C 767. The Supreme Courthad taken into account the tenets of penology and examined the issue that if the deathsentenceis to be commuted toimprisonment forlife, then 14 years conviction would not be a proper punishment. A proper course would be to expand the option and take over what as a matter of fact lawfully belongs to the Court, i.e., the vast hiatus between 14 years'imprisonment and death. For the purpose of execution of alifesentence, the Supreme Courtproceeded to examine the scope of limiting the benefit of remissions, which are given by the State. Where after claiming the benefit of remission, thesentenceis only of 14 years, a special category ofsentence, instead of deathsentence, can be substituted by the punishment ofimprisonment forlife, or for a term exceeding fourteen years and put that category beyond application of remission is well founded principle. 28. Keeping in view the abovse prayer, the appeal qua merit is dismissed, and this Courtproceeds to examine the issue of commuting deathsentencetoimprisonment forlife.29.

    "text": "State Of Uttarakhand vs Sartaj on 16 May, 2024 26) In 1973, the Supreme Courtin the case of Jagmohan Singh Vs State of U. P.(1973) 1 S C C 20, examined the question whether deathsentenceawarded by acourtunder Section 302 of Indian Penal Code, 1880 was violative of sub-clause (1) of Article 19 of the Constitution. As per Sub- Section (5) of Section 367 of Criminal Procedure Code, there was a discretion with thecourteither to award capitalsentenceorlifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtheld that Article 19 of the Constitution does not directly deal with the freedom to live. It is not included in the seven freedoms mentioned in that Article. As far as India is concerned, capital punishment cannot be described as unusual because that kind of punishment has been with us from ancient times right up to the present day though the number of offences for which it can be imposed has continuously changed. The framers of our Constitution were well aware of the existence of capital punishment as a permissible punishment under the law. The other Articles in the Constitution, viz., Section 72(1)(c), 72(3),21 and 134 and Sections 401 and 402 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Entries 1 and 2 in List I I I of the Seventh Schedule, all indicate that capitalsentencehas not been regarded per se as unreasonable or not in the public interest.37) Recently, the Supremecourtin the case of Digambar Vs The State of Maharashta, 2023 2 Cri C C 647, had an occasion to examine whether death penalty could be awarded in case of an honour killing. In that case, the Supreme Courtobserved that the appellant Digambar was a young boy of 25 years at the time of incident and had not acted in a brutal manner as there was one single injury inflicted on both deceased. As far as offence punishable under Section 302 is concerned, the Supreme Courtheld that the prosecution had established that the deceased and accused persons left the house together and soon thereafter the death of deceased person had occurred. The accused were held guilty of the offence punishable under Section 302 I P C. However, keeping in view the fact that appellant Digambar was 25 years of age, it was not considered to be a 'rarest of rare' case. He was held to be not a person with criminal mindset and criminal records, and in this backdrop, thesentenceof capital punishment was committed tolifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courthad also taken into account the report of the Probation Officer. As per said report, the Sarpanch and people of the village had stated that inter-caste marriage of deceased friend Govind and deceased sister Pooja was putting social pressure and being angry about it, the incident took place in sudden provocation by Digambar. However, overall behaviour of Digamber was found to be good.42) Supreme Courtin the case of B. A. Umesh Vs Union of India and others, Criminal Appeal No. 1892 of 2022 (arising out of S L P ( Crl.) No. 890 of 2022, decided on 04.11.2022, has also examined the issue whether delay in execution of deathsentencecould be a sufficient ground for substituting deathsentencebyimprisonment forlife. In the above matter, the Supreme Courtwas examining the case where the execution of deathsentencewas due to the delay which took place in execution of the deathsentencedue to pendency of mercy petition and reference was made to a judgment of Ajay Kumar Pal Vs Union of India and another, 2015 (2) S C C 478. In that case there was a delay of 03 years and 10 months, which was found to be inordinate and the delay was not attributed to the accused / petitioner but the delay was found on account of functionaries and authorities in question.45) In A. G. Perarivalan Vs Statethrough Superintendent of Police and another, 2022 S C C Online S C 635, a bench of three Judges of Supreme Courthad commuted thesentenceof death tolifein a petition filed under Article 161 of the Constitution keeping in view the fact that the petition remained pending for 2½ years with the Hon'ble Governor, despite recommendation of the State Cabinet for remission of thesentence.46) In the same judgment, the Supreme Courtexamined the case of solitary confinement of a convict under Section 29 of the Prisons Act, 1894. The lawlaid down bythe Supreme Courtin Sunil Batra Vs Delhi Administration and others, (1978) 4 S C C 494, and Ajay Kumar Pal's case (supra), where the convict had been kept in solitary confinement after awarding the deathsentencetill his mercy petition was disposed of was declared as a long period of incarceration. In the case before the Supreme Courtthe solitary confinement was w.e.f. 2006 to 2016 for a period of 10 years, and hence it was held that incarceration of 10 years of solitary confinement would have ill effects on the well-being of the convict and, in this backdrop, the appellant was entitled to have the deathsentenceimposed upon him to be commuted to deathsentencetoimprisonment forlife, and finally the Supreme Courtheld that mercy petition must be filed within 07 days of the disposal of the appeal or dismissal of the Special Leave Petition, and the convict is entitled to file a review petition within 30 days. 26) In 1973, the Supreme Courtin the case of Jagmohan Singh Vs State of U.

In that case there was a delay of 03 years and 10 months, which was found to be inordinate and the delay was not attributed to the accused / petitioner but the delay was found on account of functionaries and authorities in question.45) In A. G. Perarivalan Vs Statethrough Superintendent of Police and another, 2022 S C C Online S C 635, a bench of three Judges of Supreme Courthad commuted thesentenceof death tolifein a petition filed under Article 161 of the Constitution keeping in view the fact that the petition remained pending for 2½ years with the Hon'ble Governor, despite recommendation of the State Cabinet for remission of thesentence.46) In the same judgment, the Supreme Courtexamined the case of solitary confinement of a convict under Section 29 of the Prisons Act, 1894. The lawlaid down bythe Supreme Courtin Sunil Batra Vs Delhi Administration and others, (1978) 4 S C C 494, and Ajay Kumar Pal's case (supra), where the convict had been kept in solitary confinement after awarding the deathsentencetill his mercy petition was disposed of was declared as a long period of incarceration. In the case before the Supreme Courtthe solitary confinement was w.e.f. 2006 to 2016 for a period of 10 years, and hence it was held that incarceration of 10 years of solitary confinement would have ill effects on the well-being of the convict and, in this backdrop, the appellant was entitled to have the deathsentenceimposed upon him to be commuted to deathsentencetoimprisonment forlife, and finally the Supreme Courtheld that mercy petition must be filed within 07 days of the disposal of the appeal or dismissal of the Special Leave Petition, and the convict is entitled to file a review petition within 30 days. 26) In 1973, the Supreme Courtin the case of Jagmohan Singh Vs State of U. P.(1973) 1 S C C 20, examined the question whether deathsentenceawarded by acourtunder Section 302 of Indian Penal Code, 1880 was violative of sub-clause (1) of Article 19 of the Constitution. As per Sub- Section (5) of Section 367 of Criminal Procedure Code, there was a discretion with thecourteither to award capitalsentenceorlifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtheld that Article 19 of the Constitution does not directly deal with the freedom to live. It is not included in the seven freedoms mentioned in that Article. As far as India is concerned, capital punishment cannot be described as unusual because that kind of punishment has been with us from ancient times right up to the present day though the number of offences for which it can be imposed has continuously changed. The framers of our Constitution were well aware of the existence of capital punishment as a permissible punishment under the law. The other Articles in the Constitution, viz., Section 72(1)(c), 72(3),21 and 134 and Sections 401 and 402 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Entries 1 and 2 in List I I I of the Seventh Schedule, all indicate that capitalsentencehas not been regarded per se as unreasonable or not in the public interest. 37) Recently, the Supremecourtin the case of Digambar Vs The State of Maharashta, 2023 2 Cri C C 647, had an occasion to examine whether death penalty could be awarded in case of an honour killing. In that case, the Supreme Courtobserved that the appellant Digambar was a young boy of 25 years at the time of incident and had not acted in a brutal manner as there was one single injury inflicted on both deceased. As far as offence punishable under Section 302 is concerned, the Supreme Courtheld that the prosecution had established that the deceased and accused persons left the house together and soon thereafter the death of deceased person had occurred. The accused were held guilty of the offence punishable under Section 302 I P C. However, keeping in view the fact that appellant Digambar was 25 years of age, it was not considered to be a 'rarest of rare' case. He was held to be not a person with criminal mindset and criminal records, and in this backdrop, thesentenceof capital punishment was committed tolifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courthad also taken into account the report of the Probation Officer. As per said report, the Sarpanch and people of the village had stated that inter-caste marriage of deceased friend Govind and deceased sister Pooja was putting social pressure and being angry about it, the incident took place in sudden provocation by Digambar. However, overall behaviour of Digamber was found to be good. 42) Supreme Courtin the case of B. A. Umesh Vs Union of India and others, Criminal Appeal No. 1892 of 2022 (arising out of S L P ( Crl.) No. 890 of 2022, decided on 04.11.2022, has also examined the issue whether delay in execution of deathsentencecould be a sufficient ground for substituting deathsentencebyimprisonment forlife. In the above matter, the Supreme Courtwas examining the case where the execution of deathsentencewas due to the delay which took place in execution of the deathsentencedue to pendency of mercy petition and reference was made to a judgment of Ajay Kumar Pal Vs Union of India and another, 2015 (2) S C C 478.

State of Punjab, A I R 1965 S C 444, p. 446.8 Ibid.9 A I R 1999 S C 3450: (1999) 9 S C C 312 1985 expired by efflux of time on 22-5-1987 but the proceedings were continued by a saving clauses under the Act. The Actof 1985 was replaced by the T A D A Act, 1987. In this Act in the corresponding Section 3(2)the harshness of thesentencewas diluted and the accused could besentencedto death orlifeimprisonment. The question before the Supreme Court, where the appeal of the accused and the reference for confirmation of deathsentencewere pending, was whether the benefit of the dilution of the harshness of deathsentenceinsection 3(2)of the 1987 Act could be given to the accused and hissentenceof death could be replaced bysentenceforlifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtin these circumstances gave the benefit of Section 3(2)of the 1987 Act to the accused andsentencedhim tolifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtgave two reasons for applyingsection 3(2)of the 1987 Act. Thecourtfirst applied a general principle in the case which was stated as follows: \" If any subsequent legislation would down grade the offence, it would be a salutory principle for administration of criminal justice to suggest that the said legislative benevolence can be extended to the accused who awaits judicial verdict regardingsentence.\"10 The second reason that the Supreme Courtgave was that the continued operation of the 1985 Act after expiry under a saving clause for continuance of criminal proceedings in respect of offences committed when the Act was in force became inconsistent, in so far thesentencepart of samesection 3(2)was concerned, withsection 3(2)of the 1987 Act and could not be given 10 Ibid, p. 3455 (para 32).",

    "text": "State vs Lala Ram on 21 November, 2008 23.4 In Vinayak Shivajirao Pol v. State of Maharashtra, (1998) 2 S C C 233, the accused suspecting fidelity of his wife killed her by strangulation. He cut off her head and thumbs. He threw the headless trunk and the head in two different wells and the thumbs at another place. Such a case was not held a rarest of rare case by the Supreme Courtand, therefore,sentenceof death awarded by the High Courtwas reduced to one ofimprisonment forlife.23.5 The principles governing imposition of deathsentencehave beenlaid down bythe Supreme Courtin (a) Lehna v. State of Haryana, (2002) 3 S C C 76, (b) Sardar Khan v. State of Karnataka, (2004) 2 S C C 442 and (c) Simon and others v. State of Karnataka, (2004) 2 S C C 694. According to the Supreme Court, imposition of deathsentencewould be justified if facts are such that to award any punishment less than deathsentencewould shock the conscience of the Courtand would be a mockery of justice. What is ruled by the Supreme Courtin the above mentioned decisions is that nature of the crime and the accused should be considered, and aggravating as well as mitigating circumstances should be weighed in the context of facts and circumstances of the case before imposing deathsentence.25. In this connection, it would be appropriate to refer to the decision of the Supreme Courtin the case of Krishan v. State of Haryana, A I R 1997 S C 2598. In the said case, the accused was already servingsentenceoflifeimprisonment. He was found guilty of committing another murder while he was released on parole. Felonious propensity of the offender was made sole basis for awarding deathsentence. On review of the facts, the Supreme Courthas held that felonious propensity of offender cannot be made sole basis for awarding deathsentence, and as it was found that the said case was not falling into category of 'rarest of rare cases', deathsentencewas commuted to one oflifeimprisonment.30. Having regard to the principleslaid down bythe Supreme Courtin several reported decisions and more particularly in view of the fact that the trial Courthas recorded conviction on the basis of circumstantial evidence, thiscourtis of the opinion that deathsentenceimposed on the accused deserves to be commuted to one of thelifeimprisonment.31. In view of the aforesaid finding, now the next question is as to what would be the appropriate punishment?32. Section 57, I P C provides that in calculating fractions of terms of punishment,imprisonment forlifeis to be reckoned as equivalent to theimprisonment for twenty years. In our view, considering the heinous barbaric offence committed by A-1, in no set of circumstances A-1 should be released before completion of 20 years ofimprisonment. The Supreme Courtin the case of Dalbir Singh Vs. State of Punjab, 1979 3 S C C 745, considered the question that in case wheresentenceof death is reduced tolifeimprisonment, for how many years accused should be detained in prison. The Supreme Courtin Paragraph 14 held thus: 23.4 In Vinayak Shivajirao Pol v. State of Maharashtra, (1998) 2 S C C 233, the accused suspecting fidelity of his wife killed her by strangulation. He cut off her head and thumbs. He threw the headless trunk and the head in two different wells and the thumbs at another place. Such a case was not held a rarest of rare case by the Supreme Courtand, therefore,sentenceof death awarded by the High Courtwas reduced to one ofimprisonment forlife.23.5 The principles governing imposition of deathsentencehave beenlaid down bythe Supreme Courtin (a) Lehna v.

The jurisprudence regarding the delay in execution of deathsentenceas a supervening circumstance is holding the field for a considerable time. The case of Vivian Rodrick V. State of West Bengal 4 came to the Supreme Courtfrom the Calcutta High Courtin the year 1971. This was an appeal by Special Leave on the question ofsentence. The Calcutta High Courttried the appellant Vivian in the exercise of its original jurisdiction. It was argued before the High Courtthat thesentenceof death should be reduced to rigorousimprisonment forlifeon account of the long delay that had taken place. The Supreme Courtobserved that if there be a case of an extremely excessive delay, that can be sufficient for imposing a lessersentenceofimprisonment forlife. The Supreme Courtconsidered the mental agony suffered where the appellant was for more than six years under the fear of death from the trialcourt's decision. Though this decision is in respect of delay during the appellate jurisdiction, it is to be noted that delay was considered as a factor in the context of the deathsentence.28. In the case of Bhagwan Bux Singh versus the State of Uttar Pradesh 5, which is again a case that arose from the appellate jurisdiction, on account of the delay, the deathsentencewas 4 1971 (1) S C C 468 5 (1978) 1 Supreme Court Cases 214 32 C R I. W P-3103.2014.doc commuted tolifeimprisonment by the Supreme Court. Similar is the case of Ram Adhar Vs State of U. P.6 wherein thesentencefor death was commuted by the Supreme Courtsince there was a delay of six years. In the case of Ediga Anamma Vs. State of Andhra Pradash 7 the Supreme Courtemphasized the ordeal of a death row convict. In the case of Sher Singh Vs. State of Punjab 8 the Bench of three learned Judges held that delay alone is not only a ground for commutation of execution of deathsentencetolifeimprisonment, and there could not be a fixed rule of two years. The matter was referred to the Constitution Bench on two issues. Firstly, whether the delay in the execution itself would be a ground for commutation ofsentenceand secondly, whether two years delay in execution will automatically result in commutation ofsentence.46. After laying down the law accordingly, the Supreme Courtexamined the matters before it on a case-to-case basis and commuted the petitioners' deathsentencestolifeimprisonment. In the case of death convict Gurmeet Singh where the delay in disposal of mercy petition was seven years eight months, the Supreme Courtcommuted the deathsentencetolifeimprisonment. Here Petitioners mercy petitions were decided and rejected with seven years, ten months and 15 days for the cause entirely attributable to the Respondents. Therefore, the Petitioners' case squarely falls within the ambit of the legal position, as summarized in the case of Shatrughan Chauhan. 27.

Once bail bond was accepted, thelifesentenceimposed on the petitioner having been suspended, the subsequentsentenceswill not run parallel with thelifesentencerather will run consecutively even though petitioner was not released on bail and remained in jail custody in the light of subsequentsentence(s) imposed on him. In support of the aforesaid contention reliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Courtin the case of Ranjit Singh vs Union Territory of Chandigarh and another(1991) 4 S C C 304 paragraphs 7 to 9. Perusal ofthe said judgmentindicates that convict of the said case was alifeconvict. While he remained on parol after his conviction andsentencefor murder, he was tried for another murder and convicted under Section 303 of the Penal Code. The second conviction was altered to one under Section 302 of the Penal Code and for the second murder also the convict wassentencedtolifeimprisonment. Supreme Courtwhile disposing of his appeal filed against the second conviction directed thatlifeimprisonment would be the propersentencewhich should be imposed upon the convict and reduced thesentenceof death intoimprisonment forlife. Supreme Courtfurther directed that the second murder was committed by the convict within a span of one year of his earlier conviction, that too, while he was on parol. As such,sentenceofimprisonment forlifeawarded to the convict subsequently should not run concurrently with his earliersentenceoflifeimprisonment. Writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India was filed asserting that the direction of the Courtawarding subsequentimprisonment forlifeshould not run concurrently with his earliersentenceoflifeimprisonment is contrary to sub-section (2) of Section 427 Cr. P. C. Supreme Courttaking note of sub-section (2) of Section 427 Cr. P. C. held that the subsequentsentenceofimprisonment forlifehas to run concurrently with the earliersentenceofimprisonment forlifeawarded to the convict. Any remission or commutation granted in respect of the earliersentenceoflifeimprisonment will not ipso facto be available in respect of the subsequentsentenceoflifeimprisonment which would continue to be unaffected by the remission or commutation in respect of the earliersentence. The operation of the super imposed subsequentsentenceoflifeimprisonment shall not be wiped out merely because in respect of the corresponding earliersentenceoflifeimprisonment any remission or commutation has been granted by the appropriate authority. The consequence is that the convict would not get any practical benefit of any remission or commutation in respect of his earliersentencebecause of the super imposed subsequentlifesentenceunless the same corresponding benefit in respect of the subsequentsentenceis also granted to the convict. Learned counsel for the State further referred to the judgment of Supreme Courtin the case of Shantilal vs State of M. P.(2007) 11 S C C 243 and with reference tothe said judgmentsubmitted thatsentencein lieu of fine i.e. defaultsentenceis a penalty for non-payment of fine cannot be taken to be substantivesentencefor offence. He also referred to the judgment of the Supreme Courtin the case of Harnam Singh Vs. The State of Himachal Pradesh A I R 1975 Supreme Court 236 and submitted that fine constitutes a liability on the estate of the convict. Appeal against conviction abates on the death of the appellant- accused except an appeal filed assailing thesentenceof fine.",

Hon'ble Supreme Courtobserved that the case was not falling within the category of rarest of rare cases. There the facts were that when the deceased was getting himself shaved by Ramphal barber in the jail, accused came there with kassi in his hand and inflicted two successive kassi blows on the head of Ranbir with whom he had a property dispute as a result of which he fell down and later died.

Inthe said decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtafter taking into consideration the catena of decisions delivered by the Supreme Courtand after analyzing the same had reached to the conclusion that the deathsentencebe commuted inlifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtin paragraph No.71 ofthe said decisionhas observed as under :47 The next decision on which Mr. Apte, the learned counsel appearing for the Appellant-accused relied upon is in the case of Santosh Kumar(supra). Inthe said decision, the Supreme Courtafter taking into consideration the entire law with respect to the category of \"rarest of rare\" case and commutation of deathsentencetolifeimprisonment, commuted the death penalty to rigorousimprisonment forlife. The third decision on which Mr. Apte placed reliance is in the case of Bantu @ Naresh Giri(supra). In the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtconfirmed the conviction of the Appellant under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, but modified thesentenceby commuting thesentenceof death toimprisonment forlifeand for the offence punishable under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, the appellant wassentencedto undergo rigorousimprisonment for ten years. Therefore, while partly allowing the appeal filed by the accused only with regard to the quantum ofsentencewe commute the deathsentenceawarded to the accused to one oflifeimprisonment under Section 302 of I P C. We also uphold thesentenceawarded to the accused under Section 376 (2) (f)of I P C. In our view, the ends of justice would sub-serve the purpose ofsentencingif both thesentences, are directed to run consecutive i.e. after the accused completes hissentenceunder section 302, thesentenceunder Section 376(2)(f) start and the accused to undergo the saidsentence. While taking this view, we are fortified by the decision of the Supreme Courtin the case of Swamy Shraddananda v. State of Karnatakareported in 2008(13) S C C 767. In the said case also the accused had beensentencedto death. The Supreme Courtfelt that it was not a fit case to award a deathsentencebut the Supreme Courtobserved that asentenceoflifeconf-1-2015.sxwimprisonment which, subject to remission, normally works out to a term of 14 years would be grossly disproportionate and inadequate. The Supreme Courtfurther observed that in such case, the Court's option is limited only to two punishments, one asentenceofimprisonment, for all intents and purposes, of not more than 14 years and the other death, in which case the Courtmay feel tempted and find itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty. Such a course would indeed be disastrous. A far more just, reasonable and proper course would be to expand the options and to take over what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs to the Court, i.e. the vast hiatus between 14 years'imprisonment and death. The Court, therefore, can substitute a deathsentencebylifeimprisonment for rest oflifeof convict or by a term in excess of fourteen years and further to direct that the convict must not be released from the prison for the rest of hislifeor for the actual terms as specified in the order, as the case may be. Observing thus, the Supreme Courtsubstituted the deathsentencebyimprisonment forlifeand directed the accused shall not be released from prison till the rest of hislife.54 At this stage a useful reference to the judgments of the Supreme Courtin the case of Ronny Vs State of Maharashtrareported in (1998) 3 S C C 625 and Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal Vs State of Maharashtrareported in (1996) 4 S C C 148. In the case of Ronny( Supra), the accused persons had conf-1-2015.sxw committed gang rape and murder of a lady during the course of the same incident. In this case, the Supreme Courtfelt it appropriate that thesentenceundersection 376(2)(g)of I. P. C. for gang rape shall run consecutively after serving thesentencefor offence of murder i.e the Supreme Courtdirected that thesentenceofimprisonment under section 376(2) (g) of 10 years R I shall be served after thesentenceoflifeimprisonment is over. So also, in the case of Ravindra Chouthmal( Supra), the Supreme Courtdirected that thesentenceof seven years R I for the offence undersection 201 of the I. P. C. be directed to run consecutively after thesentenceof thelifeimprisonment had run its course. In the case of Ravindra Chouthmal, the accused had murdered his wife and thereafter to cause the evidence of the crime to disappear, he had cut the body and thrown the head in the creek. It is to be noted here that the Supreme Courtin the said case has commuted thesentenceof death penalty tolifeimprisonment and further directed that thesentenceawarded to the accused therein to run concurrently. Inthe said decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtafter taking into consideration the catena of decisions delivered by the Supreme Courtand after analyzing the same had reached to the conclusion that the deathsentencebe commuted inlifeimprisonment.

As far as the second question is concerned, the trialcourtwhile awarding thesentencehas taken into account various factors and also considered the judgments of the Supreme Courtas well as of this Court. We may say that there is no quarrel with the proposition of the law laid down. However, what requires consideration is as to whether the judgments are applicable to the facts of the present case or not?47. In the case of Swamy Shraddananda (2) v. State of Karnataka, reported in (2008) 13 S C C 767, a three Judge Bench of the Supreme Courtwas seized of the issue that whether the conviction of the appellant under Section 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code had attained finality. The trialcourtand High Courthadsentencedthe appellant to death. On an appeal before the Supreme Court, a two Judge Bench in Swamy Shraddananda (1) v. State of Karnataka, reported in (2007) 12 S C C 288 unanimously upheld the appellants conviction but the Courtwas unable to agree as to the punishment to be meted out to the appellant. One of the learned Judges felt that the punishment oflifeimprisonment rather than death would serve the ends of justice. The Judge also had made it clear that the appellant would not be released from prison till the end of hislife. The other learned Judge, on the other hand, took the view that the appellant deserved death. Resultantly, the matter was placed before a three Judge Bench whereby the deathsentencewas commuted toimprisonment forlifewith a direction that the appellant would not be released from prison till the end of hislife. In the aforesaid matter, while re-visiting the entire law on the issue ofsentencing, the Supreme Courtheld that thesentenceofimprisonment for actuallifegiven to a convict as a substitute for deathsentencemust be viewed differently and segregated from the ordinarylifeimprisonment given as thesentenceof first choice. The Courtanalysed that when a deathsentencecomes up for confirmation, the Courtis often faced with two punishments - one issentenceforimprisonment, which for all intents and purposes relates to fourteen years and the other is death. Resultantly, the Courtmay feel tempted and finds itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty. The Courtalso held that it was far more reasonable and proper to expand the options and take recourse to the expanded option for a special category and substitute thesentenceoflifeimprisonment and attract actual term ofimprisonment to be undergone by a convict without the same be subject to remission, computation, etc. It would be useful to refer to the following paragraphs of the judgment with regard to the issue of computation and remission:",

The learned counsel for the petitioner Mr. Mohideen Basha submitted that in S.2(1) of the Tamilnadu Borstal Scchools Act ( Act in short) relating to \"adolescent offender\", the expression \"imprisonment\" should be read to include \"imprisonment forlife\". The learned counsel submitted that, with great respect, the view of the Division Bench in Palanisamy's case (cited supra) is not correct. The learned counsel submitted that the decision in Ganapathy, In Re (1982 L. W. ( Crl) 217), where it was held that a person convicted andsentencedto undergoimprisonment forlifewould not be covered by Section 8 of the Tamil Nadu Borstal Schools Act had been overruled in State of Andhra Pradesh V. Vallabhapuram Ravi(1984 S. C. C. ( Crl) 635). The learned counsel submitted that in Ramasamy's case (cited supra), the Division Bench held that on a consideration of the various decisions of the Supreme Courtwhile sustaining the conviction of the appellant who wassentencedtoimprisonment forlife, had quashed thesentence. The learned counsel submitted that if the Division Bench which heard Palanisamy's case (cited supra) was not inclined to agree with this view, then the proper course would have been to refer it to a Full Bench. The Division Bench did not make any difference between the \"adolescent offenders\" who were charged with offences for which the punishment ofimprisonment forlifewassentencedand also the \"offenders\" who were charged with offences for which the punishment ofimprisonment forlifewassentenced. In any event, in Kamalanantha's case the Supreme Courthas clearly held thatimprisonment includesimprisonment forlifealso.10.6. In Kamalanantha v. State of T. N.((2005) 5 S. C. C. 194), it was held thus at page 229 :10.7. To the same effect is the judgment of the Division Bench ( In Re Yakub, C. A. No.1223 of 1970 dated 2.12.1971) which was quoted in re Ganapathy's case. Though, of course, in re Yakub's case, the Courtheld that the distiction must be retained in Bortsal Schools Act But in view of the law laid down by the Supreme Courtthatimprisonment includesimprisonment forlife, we see no reaon why we should understand Section 2(1)as including only those who aresentencedtoimprisonment for a term, and not offenders who aresentencedtoimprisonment forlife. A construction of such nature would neither be in consonance with the spirit of the Act, but it would also be contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Courtin Kamlanantha's case. We have already seen that in Vallabhapuram Ravi's case, the Supreme Courthad construed Section 10 Ain favour of the \"adolescent offenders\" and held that the words 'unexpired residue of thesentence' cannot mean that the adolescent offender should be sent back to prison so that the protection given by Section 8 would apply in full force, but it would mean that they should be sent to Borstal Schools, which would be for a period of five years or till the offender reaches the age of 23 years.10.8. Insofar as the manner in which the Section has to be interpreted, the Supreme Courtin New India Assurance Co. vs. Nusli Neville Wadia(2007 (14) S C A L E 556), while dealing with the question how to read the provisions of an Act in a proper and effective manner which would lead the beneficiary under the statutory scheme to fulfill its constitutional obligations, quoted the following observations of Justice Aharon Barak of the Supreme Courtof Israel on purposive interpretation :- 2. The learned counsel for the petitioner Mr. Mohideen Basha submitted that in S.2(1) of the Tamilnadu Borstal Scchools Act ( Act in short) relating to \"adolescent offender\", the expression \"imprisonment\" should be read to include \"imprisonment forlife\". The learned counsel submitted that, with great respect, the view of the Division Bench in Palanisamy's case (cited supra) is not correct.

A convict undergoing suchsentencemay earn remissions of his part ofsentence, but such remissions in the absence of an order of an appropriate Government remitting the entire balance of hissentenceetc. does not entitle the convict to be released automatically before the fulllifeterm is served.

King Emperor ( A I R 1945 P C 64) where it was held by the Privy Council as follows: Therefore, order has to be passed by the Government taking into account the facts of the case.6. In Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra, ( A I R 1961 S C 600), it was held by the Supreme Courtas follows:\"....... Asentenceof transportation forlifeorimprisonment forlifemust prima facie be treated as transportation orimprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted person's naturallife.\" The Courtfurther observed thus:\"..... But, the Prisons Actdoes not confer on any authority a power to commute or remitsentences; it provides only for the regulation of prisons and for the treatment of prisoners confined therein. Section 59 of the Prisoners Act confers a power on the State Government to make rules, inter alia, for rewards for good conduct. Therefore, the rules made under the Act should be construed within the scope of the ambit of the Act..... Under the said rules the orders of an appropriate Government under Section 401, Criminal Procedure Code, are prerequisite for a release. No other rule has been brought to our notice which confers an indefeasible right on a prisonersentencedto transportation forlifeto an unconditional release on the expiry of a particular term including remission. The rules under the Prisons Actdo not substitute a lessersentencefor asentenceof transportation forlife.\" 5. In Life Convict Laxman Naskar v. State of West Bengal and Anr., (2000 A I R S C W 3060), the Supreme Courtheld thatsentenceforimprisonment forlifeordinarily meansimprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted person's naturallife. A convict undergoing suchsentencemay earn remissions of his part ofsentence, but such remissions in the absence of an order of an appropriate Government remitting the entire balance of hissentenceetc. does not entitle the convict to be released automatically before the fulllifeterm is served. Even the provisions in the Jail Manual or in the Rules equating with a period of 20 years does not confer any indefeasible right on a person to be unconditionally released on the expiry of such particular term and such rules also will not benefit alifeconvict.

    "text": "State vs Aru Alias Arun Kumar Pradhan on 16 July, 1984 The Supreme Courthas observed in A I R 1981 S. C. 1710 : 1981 Cr. L. J. 1446- Ummilal v. State of Madhya Pradesh That when murder has been committed under a sudden impulse in a grave fit of rage, ends of justice would be met bysentencingthe accused toimprisonment forlife. Referring to the case of Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, the Supreme Courthas observed in 1983(1) Crimes 784-- Erabhadrappa @ Krishappa v. State of Karnataka That thesentenceof death should not be passed except in the arrest of the rare cases.37. Foe passing thesentenceof death, reference has been made by the learned Sessions Judge to the case reported in A I R 1983 S. C.594 (supra) In That case, however, the appellant had committed multiple murders and robbery and the Supreme Courthad observed That no ground for substituting thesentenceoflifeimprisonment for death could be perceived. According to the Supreme Court, it was truely the rarest of the rare cases and accordingly the deathsentencewas confirmed.38. In our view, the case before us is one of the many cases which one comes across where murders have been committed owing to land disputes. The prosecution had sought to build its case as if it was one of conspiracy between the appellant and his mother (acquitted co-accused). The case of the prosecution and the evidence led in its support was that on the day prior to the fateful day of occurrence, the co-accused had 'threatened by saying That the deceased would be killed. On the day of occurrence, it was alleged, when the deceased was moving on the village road, the co-accused instigated the appellant to kill her. This part of the prosecution case as against the co-accused has not been accepted by the trial Court. Having lost in the litigation against the deceased and with a sense of frustration and despair, the appellant appears to have taken the opportunity of killing the deceased on the spur of the moment when she was moving on the village road. There was no evidence That the appellant was aware of the fact That the deceased was then pregnant. The offence appears to have been committed by the appellant in moments of emotional disturbance. Killing is cruel and, therefore, all murders are cruel. But such cruelty may vary in its degree of culpability and it is only when the culpability assumes the proportion of extreme depravation That special reasons can legitimately be said to exist for passing the extreme penalty of the law, as observed in A I R 1980 5. C.898 (supra). The act of the appellant has not been committed after previous plannig and does not, in our view, involve exceptional depravity. Ends of justice can be me-: in a case bysentencingan accused toimprisonment forlifewhen the murder has been committed under a sadden impulse in a grave fit of rage, as has been done in the instant case by the appellant when he saw the deceased, who had succeeded in her litigation against him, moving on the village road. Deathsentenceis, to be imposed only whenlifeimprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment. The act of murder committed by the appellant was not something uncommon. What seems to have prompted the mind of the appellant is not immediate gain by the commission of the murder, but his sense of frustration and disappointment in connection with, the litigation between him and the deceased. There are no special reasons, in our view, for imposing the deathsentence. We are, therefore, of the view That it would meet the ends of justice if instead ofsentencingthe appellant to death, he issentencedto undergoimprisonment forlife. The Supreme Courthas observed in A I R 1981 S. C. 1710 : 1981 Cr. L. J. 1446- Ummilal v. State of Madhya Pradesh That when murder has been committed under a sudden impulse in a grave fit of rage, ends of justice would be met bysentencingthe accused toimprisonment forlife.

    "text": "Haja Moideen And Etc. vs Government Of India And Ors., Etc. on 15 December, 1989 \" Making all reasonable allowance for the time necessary for appeal and consideration of reprieve, we think that delay exceeding two years in the execution of asentenceof death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person undersentenceof death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of thesentenceof death\" This view of the Supreme Courtin Vatheeswaran's case was dissented by a Bench of three Judges in Sher Singh v. State of Punjab. The Supreme Courtconfirmed the view that prolonged in execution of a deathsentencewas unquestionably an important consideration for determining whether thesentenceshould be allowed to be executed, but no hard and fast rule could be laid down that \"delay exceeding two years in the execution of asentenceof death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person undersentenceof death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of thesentenceof death\". To this extent the decision in \" Vatheeswaran's case was overruled. The Supreme Courtin the latter case took note of the fact of common experience as regards the time generally occupied by proceedings in the High Court, the Supreme Courtand before the Executive Authorities and, therefore, felt that no absolute or unqualified rule could be laid down that in every case in which there was a long delay in the execution of a deathsentence, thesentenceshould be substituted by thesentenceoflifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtalso referred to the not uncommon practice of the prisoners filing a series of writ petitions and review petitions challenging judgments and orders, which had assumed finality, without any seeming justification. Though deathsentenceshould not, as far as possible, be imposed, but when it had been imposed in rare and exceptional cases wherein thatsentencewas also upheld by the Apexcourt, the judgment or order of thecourtsought not to be allowed to be defeated by applying any rule of thumb. However, the Supreme Courtin Sher Singh's case took the opportunity to impress upon the Government of India and the State Governments that petitions filed under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution or under Sections 432 and 433 of the Criminal Procedure Code should be disposed of expeditiously. As observed inthe said decision, a self imposed rule should be followed by executive authorities rigorously, that every such petition shall be disposed of within a period of three months from the date on which it was received. Long and interminable delays in the disposal of these petitions were a serious hurdle in the dispensation of justice and indeed, such delays tended to shake the confidence of the people in the very system of justice.18. The important question whether prolonged delay in execution of deathsentence, rendered deathsentenceinexecutable and entitled the accused to demand the alternatesentenceoflifeimprisonment was considered by a five Judge Bench of the Supreme Courtin Smt. Triveniben v. State of Gujarat, to resolve the conflict in the views expressed in Vatheeswaran's case, and Sher Singh's case, . The Supreme Courtin Triveniben's case overruled the earlier decision in Vatheeswaran's case, to that extent, that no fixed period of delay could be held to make thesentenceof death inexecutable. In this case Jagannatha Shetty, J., while concurring with the majority view, chose to consider independently the various facets of this question placed before the Supreme Court. The majority view was rendered by Oza. J., The lawlaid down bythe majority is clear and categoric that so long as the matter was pending in any Courtbefore final adjudication, the person who had been condemned or who had beensentencedto death had a ray of hope. Therefore, it was the opinion of the Supreme Courtthat it could not be contended that a person suffered that mental torture which a person suffered when he knew that he was to be hanged, but was waiting for the Dooms- Day. The delay which could, therefore, be considered while dealing with the question of communication ofsentenceof death into one of thelifeimprisonment could only be from the date of pronouncement of judgment by the apexcourtwhen the judicial process had come to an end. The Courtobserved that undue long delay in execution of thesentenceof death would entitle the condemned person to approach the Supreme Courtunder Article 32, butcourtwould only examine the nature of delay caused and circumstances ensued aftersentencewas finally confirmed by the Judicial process and will have no jurisdiction to re-open the conclusion reached by thecourtwhile finally maintaining thesentenceof death. However, thecourtmay consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all circumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of thesentenceof death should be carried out or should be altered intoimprisonment forlife. No fixed period of delay could be held to make thesentenceof death inexecutable. \" Making all reasonable allowance for the time necessary for appeal and consideration of reprieve, we think that delay exceeding two years in the execution of asentenceof death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person undersentenceof death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of thesentenceof death\" This view of the Supreme Courtin Vatheeswaran's case was dissented by a Bench of three Judges in Sher Singh v.

However, in Machhi Singh, thecourthad grafted some categories in which the community should demand the deathsentence. Noting the variations on account of the passage of time since 20 th July, 1983 when Machhi Singh was decided, the Courtheld that though the categories framed in Machhi Singh are useful, they cannot be taken as ―inflexible, absolute or immutable‖ (para 28). It further ruled that the ―rarest of rare case‖ formulation is a relative theory which requires comparison with other cases of murder; Machhi Singh translated this relative category into absolute terms by framing five categories. In Swamy Shraddananda, thecourtobserved that in interpreting Bachan Singh, Machhi Singh had actually enlarged the scope of cases by which the death penalty should be imposed beyond what the Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh had envisaged. Machhi Singh laid down the rarest of rare criteria (para(d) (2011) 10 S C C 389, Sham v. State of Maharashtra : The appellant was convicted of a triple murder of his brother, brother's wife and son because of a property dispute. Upon conviction, the trialcourtsentencedhim toimprisonment forlife. The High Courtdismissed the appellant's appeal; allowed the State appeal and enhanced thesentenceoflifeimprisonment to death. The Supreme Courtnoted that the appellant was 38 years of age; no weapon much less dangerous was used in the commission of the offence; he was 38 years of age; his antecedents were unblemished; it could not be said that the appellant would be a menace to society or that he could not be reformed or rehabilitated or would constitute a continued threat to society. It was further noted that the appellant was unemployed and that he had spent 10 years in prison, out of Crl. A. Nos.910, 741, 958/2008, Crl. Rev. P. No.369/2008, Crl. A. Nos.1322/2011 & 145/2012 pg. 62 which five were in the death cell. Thecourtalso noted that while enhancing thesentence, the High Courthad not assigned adequate and acceptable reasons while the trialcourthad opportunity of noting the demeanour of witnesses as well as the accused. Thecourttherefore, restored thesentenceimposed by the trialcourt.(h) We now note two cases of rape and murder that came up before the Supreme Courtwhere thecourtsentencedthe offender toimprisonment forlife. In (2012) 5 S C C 766, Neel Kumar v. State of Haryana, the appellant was convicted for the rape and murder of his four year old daughter.

The State of Punjab, in paragraph 3 of the judgment, the facts of the case have been adverted to. The appellant before the Supreme Courtafter serving out thesentenceof six months' rigorousimprisonment for the offence under Section 323 imposed upon him by the Sessions Court, was on bail throughout the duration of the appeal before the High Courtand since the appeal was allowed and he was convicted for the offence under Section 302 andsentencedtolifeimprisonment, he surrendered before presenting his petition for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, since then, the appellant was in jail and the total period thus passed in Jail up to that date was about 4 1/2 years. The appeal was of 1974 and it was not likely to come up for hearing for at least another two years, since Supreme Courtwas then hearing appeals preferred in the year 1972. The Supreme Courthas observed that from the fact that Supreme Courthad granted to the appellant special leave to appeal against his conviction showed that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, he had prima facie a good case to consider and in the circumstances, it would be highly unjust to detain the appellant in jail any longer during the hearing of the appeal. The appellant, therefore, was ordered to be released on bail. It is to be noticed that even in such a case, the Supreme Courthas no laid down any general rule. The Supreme Courthas also noticed the facts before it in the particular case and has then thought it fit to release the person on bail. No assistance, therefore, can be derived from this decision by the petitioners in the present group on the issue in question.32. The Supreme Courtwhile considering the effect of delay in disposal of the mercy petitions under Article 72 or 161 or delay in the execution of the deathsentencein the case of Smt. Triveniben v. State of Gujarathad an occasion to consider Article 21 of the Constitution of India and after referring to various judgments of the High Courtsand also those of the Supreme Court, it has observed that the delay in judicial proceedings should not be the ground for computing thesentenceof death to that ofsentenceofimprisonment forlife. It is observed that Article 21, which has received a creative connotation, demands that any procedure which takes away thelifeand liberty of persons must be reasonable, just and fair. This procedural fairness is required to be observed at every stage and till the last breath of thelife. The petitioners were asserting before the Supreme Courtforlifeimprisonment instead ofsentencefor death solely on the ground of prolonged delay in the execution. The Supreme Courtobserved (at p. 1357 of A I R): 16. In the case of Kashmira Singh v. The State of Punjab, in paragraph 3 of the judgment, the facts of the case have been adverted to. The appellant before the Supreme Courtafter serving out thesentenceof six months' rigorousimprisonment for the offence under Section 323 imposed upon him by the Sessions Court, was on bail throughout the duration of the appeal before the High Courtand since the appeal was allowed and he was convicted for the offence under Section 302 andsentencedtolifeimprisonment, he surrendered before presenting his petition for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, since then, the appellant was in jail and the total period thus passed in Jail up to that date was about 4 1/2 years. The appeal was of 1974 and it was not likely to come up for hearing for at least another two years, since Supreme Courtwas then hearing appeals preferred in the year 1972. The Supreme Courthas observed that from the fact that Supreme Courthad granted to the appellant special leave to appeal against his conviction showed that in the opinion of the Supreme Court, he had prima facie a good case to consider and in the circumstances, it would be highly unjust to detain the appellant in jail any longer during the hearing of the appeal.

Under those circumstances the Hon'ble Supreme Courtheld that it would be unjust to confirm the deathsentenceimposed upon Harbans.

The Supreme Courtalso found that President of India had already rejected the mercy petition of Harbans. But the Courtfelt all the relevant facts were not before the President.

Three persons weresentencedto death by a common judgment and, regretfully, each one has eventually met with a different fate. One of those three persons, Jeeta Singh, who did not file any Review Petition or Writ Petition in the Supreme Courtwas executed on 06.10.1981. The other person, Kashmira Singh, succeeded in having his deathsentencecommuted intolifeimprisonment. The Petitioner was to be executed on the same day on which Jeeta Singh was executed but, fortunately, he filed this Writ Petition on which the Supreme Courtpassed an order staying the execution of his deathsentence.54. Further observed that it is unfortunate that Jeeta Singh could not get the benefit of the commutation of Kashmira Singh'ssentence. Were he to approach the Courtlike the Petitioner, thesentenceimposed upon him would have been commuted intolifeimprisonment because no distinction could have been made between his case and that of Kashmira Singh whosesentencewas commuted prior to the execution of Jeeta Singh.55. Accordingly observed, in view of the background of the case, it would not be wrong if they were themselves to commute thesentenceof death imposed upon the Petitioner toimprisonment forlife. But in the interest of comity between the powers of the Supreme Courtand the powers of the Hon'ble President of India, it will be more in the fitness of things if they were to recommend that the Hon'ble President of India may be so good as to exercise his power under Article 72 of the Constitution to commute the deathsentenceimposed upon the Petitioner intoimprisonment forlife. This is so because the President of India has already considered the mercy petition of the Petitioner once and has rejected it. Therefore, their Lordships recommended that for reasons aforesaid, which could not have been before the President of India when he rejected the mercy petition, he may commute the deathsentenceimposed upon the Petitioner.57. In Para 18 of the afore cited judgment, it is observed that it will be a sheer travesty of justice and the course of justice will be perverted, if for the very same offence, the Petitioner has to swing and pay the extreme penalty of death whereas the deathsentenceimposed on his co-accused for the very same offence is commuted to one oflifeimprisonment and thelifeof the co- accused is spared. The case of the Petitioner Harbans Singh appears, indeed, to be unfortunate, as neither in his special leave petition and the review petition in the Supreme Courtnor in his mercy petition to the President of India, this all important and significant fact that thelifesentenceimposed on his co-accused in respect of the very same offence has been commuted to one oflifeimprisonment has been mentioned. Had this fact been brought to the notice of the Courtat the time when the Courtdealt with the special leave petition of the Petitioner or even his review petition, the Supreme Courtwould have commuted his deathsentenceto one oflifeimprisonment. For the same offence and for the same kind of involvement, responsibility and complicity, capital punishment on one andlifeimprisonment on the other would never have been just. Had the Petitioner in his mercy petition to the President of India made any mention of this fact of commutation of deathsentenceto one oflifeimprisonment on his co-accused in respect of the very same offence, the President might have been inclined to take a different view on his petition. 52. However, the Supreme Courtobserved that the course which this case has taken makes a sad reading. Three persons weresentencedto death by a common judgment and, regretfully, each one has eventually met with a different fate. One of those three persons, Jeeta Singh, who did not file any Review Petition or Writ Petition in the Supreme Courtwas executed on 06.10.1981.

From the facts narrated above, it is obvious that the nine convicts in question cannot claim release under Clause (a) of para 2 of the said G. O. Ms. No. 580. The question now narrows down to whether eight of them i.e., excluding convict No. 8063, ought to have been released under Clause (b) of the said para 2 because they are 'the otherlifers not governed by S. 433 A' of the Code who have undergone a totalsentenceof 5 years. On a plain, natural and reasonable reading of the said para 2, we do not find any difficulty in answering this question. The obvious meaning to be given to the expression 'the otherlifers' in Clause (b) islifers other than those falling under Clause (a). Though Clause (a) uses the expression 'prisonerssentencedfor thelifeimprisonment', that expression means the same as 'lifers'. The dictionary meaning of the word 'lifer' is 'a personsentencedforlife'. In other words the expression 'lifers' and 'lifeconvicts' mean the same a prisonerssentencedtolifeimprisonment. In Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Courtheld that asentenceofimprisonment forlifemust prima facie be treated as \"imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted person's naturallife\". Krishna Iyyer, J., in Maru Ram's case, used the expression 'lifers' describing it as a 'vogue word', for brevity for describinglifeconvicts i.e., personssentencedtoimprisonment forlife. We regret that we are unable to persuade ourselves to agree with the interpretation given to Clause (b) of para 2 by the Division Bench. We do not see why Clause (a) of para 2 should be confined to prisonerssentencedtolifeimprisonment by a Courtwhen there is no such limitation in the said Clause - the said Clause only says 'the prisonerssentencedforlifeimprisonment' and not 'the prisonerssentencedforlifeimprisonment by Courts'. Thus, prisoners whom the Courthas actuallysentencedto death which has since been commuted by the appropriate Government under S. 433(a)of the Code tolifeimprisonment also fall within the expression 'prisonerssentencedfor thelifeimprisonment' in Clause (a) of the said para 2 of the G. O. In this connection it has to be noticed that the language of S. 433 A of the Code is more explicit and unambiguous when it refers to \"where asentenceof death imposed on a person has been commuted under S. 433 into one ofimprisonment forlife\" and the Supreme Courtin Maru Ram's case, has elaborated by categorising such persons as \"persons whom the Courthas actuallysentencedto death which has since been commuted by the appropriate Government under S. 433(a)of the Criminal Procedure Code forlifeimprisonment\" - in the case of such persons it is obvious that thesentenceofimprisonment forlifeis not imposed by the Courtbut nonetheless they are personssentencedforlifeimprisonment even though the imposition ofsentencein thier case is not by the Courtand they have to undergo thesentenceforlifeimprisonment because of the commutation of the deathsentenceto one of imrpisonment forlife: it cannot be said that those persons do not fall within the category of personssentencedforlifeimprisonment, which is the expression used in Clause (a) of para 2 of the G. O. in question. We are afraid that the Division Bench is not right in concluding that this category oflifers i.e., those on whom asentenceof death is imposed which has been subsequently commuted to one ofimprisonment forlife, do not fall under the said Clause (a). If that is so, the expression 'the otherlifers' in Clause (b) of para 2 of the said G. O. cannot be restriced only those who aresentencedtolifeimprisonment by virtue of commutation of thesentenceof death imposed on them to one ofimprisonment forlife. 5. From the facts narrated above, it is obvious that the nine convicts in question cannot claim release under Clause (a) of para 2 of the said G. O. Ms. No. 580. The question now narrows down to whether eight of them i.e., excluding convict No. 8063, ought to have been released under Clause (b) of the said para 2 because they are 'the otherlifers not governed by S. 433 A' of the Code who have undergone a totalsentenceof 5 years. On a plain, natural and reasonable reading of the said para 2, we do not find any difficulty in answering this question. The obvious meaning to be given to the expression 'the otherlifers' in Clause (b) islifers other than those falling under Clause (a). Though Clause (a) uses the expression 'prisonerssentencedfor thelifeimprisonment', that expression means the same as 'lifers'. The dictionary meaning of the word 'lifer' is 'a personsentencedforlife'. In other words the expression 'lifers' and 'lifeconvicts' mean the same a prisonerssentencedtolifeimprisonment. In Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Courtheld that asentenceofimprisonment forlifemust prima facie be treated as \"imprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted person's naturallife\". Krishna Iyyer, J., in Maru Ram's case, used the expression 'lifers' describing it as a 'vogue word', for brevity for describinglifeconvicts i.e., personssentencedtoimprisonment forlife.",

    "text": "Vadilal Pochabhai Thakkar vs State Of Gujarat on 21 September, 1987 14. It appears from the directions given by the learned trial Judge in the final order that the accused who were convicted andsentencedwere entitled to set off under Section 428 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. All the accused aresentencedtoimprisonment forlifefor the offence of murder punishable under Section 302 and/or Section 302 read with Section 149 I. P. C.15. In the case of Kartar Singh and Ors. v. State of Haryana, the Supreme Courtheld that the benefit of set off under Section 428 of the Code was not available to persons who aresentencedtoimprisonment forlife, because the benefit of Section 428 is available only to persons who aresentencedtoimprisonment for a term and theimprisonment forlifewas not asentencefor a term. This decision of the Supreme Courtcame up for consideration before the Supreme Courtin the case of Bhagirath v. Delhi Administration. The Supreme Courtafter discussing the earlier decision held that the benefit of Section 428 of the Code was available to the persons who aresentencedtoimprisonment forlife, but that was subject to the provisions contained in Section 433 A and provided that orders have been passed by appropriate authority under Section 432 or 433 of the Code. Section 432 of the Code empowers the appropriate Government either to suspend the execution orsentenceor remit the whole or any part of the punishment to which he has beensentenced. Section 433 of the Code empowers the appropriate Government to commute, without the consent of the personsentenced, asentenceofimprisonment forlife, lor punishment for a term not exceeding fourteen years or for fins Section 433 A imposes certain restrictions on the appropriate Government while exercising the powers under Section 432 or 433 of the Code. Section 433 A provides that a person who issentencedtoimprisonment forlifefor an offence for which death is one of the punishments provided by law, such person shall not be released from prison unless he had served at least fourteen years ofimprisonment. In view of this decision of the Supreme Court, while directing that set off should be given under Section 428 to a personsentencedtoimprisonment forlifefor any offence, the Sessions Courtshould give directions in that regard as per the directions given by the Supreme Courtin the case of Bhagirath v. Delhi Administration(supra) which are reproduced above.17. The learned trial Judge convicted the accused of the offences punishable under Sections 147 and 148. Section 147 I. P. C. provides punishment for rioting while Section 148 provides for enhanced punishment if any of the accused who is a member of the unlawful assembly while committing the rioting is armed with a deadly weapon which is likely to cause death. Section 148 I. P. C. is thus an aggravated form of Section 147 I. P. C. and, therefore, the accused should not have been convicted for both the offences. We are, therefore, inclined to set aside the order of conviction andsentenceso far as the offence punishable under Section 147 I. P. C. is concerned. 14. It appears from the directions given by the learned trial Judge in the final order that the accused who were convicted andsentencedwere entitled to set off under Section 428 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. All the accused aresentencedtoimprisonment forlifefor the offence of murder punishable under Section 302 and/or Section 302 read with Section 149 I. P. C.15. In the case of Kartar Singh and Ors. v.

He had lost his mother when he was only four and a half years old. He was brought up by his stepmother. Convict- appellant was an alcoholic, and as per the evidence brought on record, he used to do only daily wage work. His mental status could not be of a satisfied person being a daily wager.65) Reference can now be made to the judgments of the Supreme Courtwhere thesentenceof capital punishment was committed tolifeimprisonment.66) In 1973, the Supreme Courtin the case of Jagmohan Singh Vs State of U. P.(1973) 1 S C C 20, examined the question whether deathsentenceawarded by acourtunder Section 302 of Indian Penal Code, 1880 was violative of sub-clause (1) of Article 19 of the Constitution. As per Sub- Section (5) of Section 367 of Criminal Procedure Code, there was a discretion with thecourteither to award capitalsentenceorlifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtheld that Article 19 of the Constitution does not directly deal with the freedom to live. It is not included in the seven freedoms mentioned in that Article. As far as India is concerned, capital punishment cannot be described as unusual because that kind of punishment has been with us from ancient times right up to the present day though the number of offences for which it can be imposed has continuously changed. The framers of our Constitution were well aware of the existence of capital punishment as a permissible punishment under the law. The other Articles in the Constitution, viz., Section 72(1)(c), 72(3),21 and 134 and Sections 401 and 402 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Entries 1 and 2 in List I I I of the Seventh Schedule, all indicate that capitalsentencehas not been regarded per se as unreasonable or not in the public interest.77) Recently, the Supremecourtin the case of Digambar Vs The State of Maharashta, 2023 2 Cri C C 647, had an occasion to examine whether death penalty could be awarded in case of an honour killing. In that case, the Supreme Courtobserved that the appellant Digambar was a young boy of 25 years at the time of incident and had not acted in a brutal manner as there was one single injury inflicted on both deceased. As far as offence punishable under Section 302 is concerned, the Supreme Courtheld that the prosecution had established that the deceased and accused persons left the house together and soon thereafter the death of deceased person had occurred. The accused were held guilty of the offence punishable under Section 302 I P C. However, keeping in view the fact that appellant Digambar was 25 years of age, it was not considered to be a 'rarest of rare' case. He was held to be not a person with criminal mindset and criminal records, and in this backdrop, thesentenceof capital punishment was committed tolifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courthad also taken into account the report of the Probation Officer. As per said report, the Sarpanch and people of the village had stated that inter-caste marriage of deceased friend Govind and deceased sister Pooja was putting social pressure and being angry about it, the incident took place in sudden provocation by Digambar. However, overall behaviour of Digamber was found to be good.82) Supreme Courtin the case of B. A. Umesh Vs Union of India and others, Criminal Appeal No. 1892 of 2022 (arising out of S L P ( Crl.) No. 890 of 2022, decided on 04.11.2022, has also examined the issue whether delay in execution of deathsentencecould be a sufficient ground for substituting deathsentencebyimprisonment forlife.83) In the above matter, the Supreme Courtwas examining the case where the execution of deathsentencewas due to the delay which took place in execution of the deathsentencedue to pendency of mercy petition and reference was made to a judgment of Ajay Kumar Pal Vs Union of India and another, 2015 (2) S C C 478. In that case there was a delay of 03 years and 10 months, which was found to be inordinate and the delay was not attributed to the accused / petitioner but the delay was found on account of functionaries and authorities in question. 64) In the facts of the present case, convict- appellant Harswroop is 24 years old poor person, and had no previous criminal history.

In that case there was a delay of 03 years and 10 months, which was found to be inordinate and the delay was not attributed to the accused / petitioner but the delay was found on account of functionaries and authorities in question. 64) In the facts of the present case, convict- appellant Harswroop is 24 years old poor person, and had no previous criminal history. He had lost his mother when he was only four and a half years old. He was brought up by his stepmother. Convict- appellant was an alcoholic, and as per the evidence brought on record, he used to do only daily wage work. His mental status could not be of a satisfied person being a daily wager.65) Reference can now be made to the judgments of the Supreme Courtwhere thesentenceof capital punishment was committed tolifeimprisonment. 66) In 1973, the Supreme Courtin the case of Jagmohan Singh Vs State of U. P.(1973) 1 S C C 20, examined the question whether deathsentenceawarded by acourtunder Section 302 of Indian Penal Code, 1880 was violative of sub-clause (1) of Article 19 of the Constitution. As per Sub- Section (5) of Section 367 of Criminal Procedure Code, there was a discretion with thecourteither to award capitalsentenceorlifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtheld that Article 19 of the Constitution does not directly deal with the freedom to live. It is not included in the seven freedoms mentioned in that Article. As far as India is concerned, capital punishment cannot be described as unusual because that kind of punishment has been with us from ancient times right up to the present day though the number of offences for which it can be imposed has continuously changed. The framers of our Constitution were well aware of the existence of capital punishment as a permissible punishment under the law. The other Articles in the Constitution, viz., Section 72(1)(c), 72(3),21 and 134 and Sections 401 and 402 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Entries 1 and 2 in List I I I of the Seventh Schedule, all indicate that capitalsentencehas not been regarded per se as unreasonable or not in the public interest. 77) Recently, the Supremecourtin the case of Digambar Vs The State of Maharashta, 2023 2 Cri C C 647, had an occasion to examine whether death penalty could be awarded in case of an honour killing. In that case, the Supreme Courtobserved that the appellant Digambar was a young boy of 25 years at the time of incident and had not acted in a brutal manner as there was one single injury inflicted on both deceased. As far as offence punishable under Section 302 is concerned, the Supreme Courtheld that the prosecution had established that the deceased and accused persons left the house together and soon thereafter the death of deceased person had occurred. The accused were held guilty of the offence punishable under Section 302 I P C. However, keeping in view the fact that appellant Digambar was 25 years of age, it was not considered to be a 'rarest of rare' case. He was held to be not a person with criminal mindset and criminal records, and in this backdrop, thesentenceof capital punishment was committed tolifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courthad also taken into account the report of the Probation Officer. As per said report, the Sarpanch and people of the village had stated that inter-caste marriage of deceased friend Govind and deceased sister Pooja was putting social pressure and being angry about it, the incident took place in sudden provocation by Digambar.

The High Courthad granted him bail but the bail order was cancelled by the Hon'ble Supreme Courtin view of non-compliance with the first proviso to Section 389(1) Cr. P. C. and the matter had been remitted to the High Courtfor fresh consideration. The appellant had sought stay of conviction on the ground that he had been working as a Principal and if the conviction is not stayed, he will lose his job, will be denied of his livelihood and he would not be in a position to participate in subsequent selection procedures conducted by the U.

    "text": "Vitthal Tukaram Atugade vs The State Of Maharashtra on 14 March, 2016 It is to be noted here that the Supreme Courtin the said case has commuted thesentenceof death penalty tolifeimprisonment and further directed that thesentenceawarded to the accused therein to run concurrently. Inthe said decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtafter taking into consideration the catena of decisions delivered by the Supreme Courtand after analyzing the same had reached to the conclusion that the deathsentencebe commuted inlifeimprisonment. The Supreme Courtin paragraph No.71 ofthe said decisionhas observed as under :47 The next decision on which Mr. Apte, the learned counsel appearing for the Appellant-accused relied upon is in the case of Santosh Kumar(supra). Inthe said decision, the Supreme Courtafter taking into consideration the entire law with respect to the category of \"rarest of rare\" case and commutation of deathsentencetolifeimprisonment, commuted the death penalty to rigorousimprisonment forlife. The third decision on which Mr. Apte placed reliance is in the case of Bantu @ Naresh Giri(supra). In the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtconfirmed the conviction of the Appellant under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, but modified thesentenceby commuting thesentenceof death toimprisonment forlifeand for the offence punishable under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, the appellant wassentencedto undergo rigorousimprisonment for ten years. Therefore, while partly allowing the appeal filed by the accused only with regard to the quantum ofsentencewe commute the deathsentenceawarded to the accused to one oflifeimprisonment under Section 302 of I P C. We also uphold thesentenceawarded to the accused under Section 376 (2) (f)of I P C. In our view, the ends of justice would sub-serve the purpose ofsentencingif both thesentences, are directed to run consecutive i.e. after the accused completes hissentenceunder section 302, thesentenceunder Section 376(2)(f) start and the accused to undergo the saidsentence. While taking this view, we are fortified by the decision of the Supreme Courtin the case of Swamy Shraddananda v. State of Karnatakareported in 2008(13) S C C 767. In the said case also the accused had beensentencedto death. The Supreme Courtfelt that it was not a fit case to award a deathsentencebut the Supreme Courtobserved that asentenceoflifeconf-1-2015.sxwimprisonment which, subject to remission, normally works out to a term of 14 years would be grossly disproportionate and inadequate. The Supreme Courtfurther observed that in such case, the Court's option is limited only to two punishments, one asentenceofimprisonment, for all intents and purposes, of not more than 14 years and the other death, in which case the Courtmay feel tempted and find itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty. Such a course would indeed be disastrous. A far more just, reasonable and proper course would be to expand the options and to take over what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs to the Court, i.e. the vast hiatus between 14 years'imprisonment and death. The Court, therefore, can substitute a deathsentencebylifeimprisonment for rest oflifeof convict or by a term in excess of fourteen years and further to direct that the convict must not be released from the prison for the rest of hislifeor for the actual terms as specified in the order, as the case may be. Observing thus, the Supreme Courtsubstituted the deathsentencebyimprisonment forlifeand directed the accused shall not be released from prison till the rest of hislife.54 At this stage a useful reference to the judgments of the Supreme Courtin the case of Ronny Vs State of Maharashtrareported in (1998) 3 S C C 625 and Ravindra Trimbak Chouthmal Vs State of Maharashtrareported in (1996) 4 S C C 148. In the case of Ronny( Supra), the accused persons had conf-1-2015.sxw committed gang rape and murder of a lady during the course of the same incident. In this case, the Supreme Courtfelt it appropriate that thesentenceundersection 376(2)(g)of I. P. C. for gang rape shall run consecutively after serving thesentencefor offence of murder i.e the Supreme Courtdirected that thesentenceofimprisonment under section 376(2) (g) of 10 years R I shall be served after thesentenceoflifeimprisonment is over. So also, in the case of Ravindra Chouthmal( Supra), the Supreme Courtdirected that thesentenceof seven years R I for the offence undersection 201 of the I. P. C. be directed to run consecutively after thesentenceof thelifeimprisonment had run its course. In the case of Ravindra Chouthmal, the accused had murdered his wife and thereafter to cause the evidence of the crime to disappear, he had cut the body and thrown the head in the creek. It is to be noted here that the Supreme Courtin the said case has commuted thesentenceof death penalty tolifeimprisonment and further directed that thesentenceawarded to the accused therein to run concurrently. Inthe said decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtafter taking into consideration the catena of decisions delivered by the Supreme Courtand after analyzing the same had reached to the conclusion that the deathsentencebe commuted inlifeimprisonment.

In the case of Jagmohan Singh Vs. State of U. Preported in (1973) 1 S C C 20, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Courthighlighted that prior to amendments in the year 1955, Section 367(5) of this Criminal Procedure Codeprovided that if the accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death and the Courtsentenceshim to any punishment other than death, the Courtshall in its judgment state the reasons whysentenceof death was not passed. Subsequently, however, a major change was effected in 1955. Now in the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 where sub-section (3) of Section 354 provides that when the conviction is for an offence punishable with death or in the alternative, withimprisonment forlifeorimprisonment for a term of years, the judgment shall state the reasons for thesentenceawarded and in the case ofsentenceof death, the special reasons for suchsentence. Significantly, thus, Page - 24 of 37 from the approach of requiring the Courtto state reasons for not awarding death penalty, the Legislature now mandates that the Courtmust state special reasons for awarding death penalty.[44] The said provision came up for consideration before a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Courtin the case of Bachan Singh Vs. State of Punjabreported in (1980) 2 S C C 684. The Courtobserved that no exhaustive enumeration of aggravating or mitigating circumstances which should be considered whensentencingan offender is possible. The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very core of the criminal law as administered in India which invests the Judges with a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment. It was further observed that discretion in the matter ofsentenceis to be exercised by the Judge judicially after balancing all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the crime. The Courtalso held thatsentenceof death ought to be given only in rarest of rare case and it should be given only when the option of awardingsentenceoflifeimprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed.[45] Ever since the judgment of the Supreme Courtin case of Bachan Singh(supra), the Courtshave been following the test of rarest of rare case in deciding the death penalty. In the later decision in case of Machhi Singh Vs.

These observations of the Supreme Courtin case of Machhi Singh(supra), have come up for minute scrutiny in some of the recent decisions. In case of Sangeet and another Vs. State of Haryanareported in (2013) 2 S C C 452, relying to the ratio in the Constitutional Bench decision on the case of Bachan Singh(supra) and also referring to the balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, propounded in case of Machhi Singh(supra), the Courtobserved as under :[52] In the case of Sebastian Vs. State of Keralareported in (2010)1 S C C 58, where the accused was convicted for rape and murder of two year old girl, the Supreme Courtrelying on the decision of Swamy Shraddananda (supra) commuted the deathsentencetoimprisonment for rest of hislife.[53] In case of Sangeet Vs.

In case of Ravishankar alias Baba Vishwakarma Vs. State of Madhya Pradeshreported in (2019) 9 S C C 689, where the accused was convicted for the offences of rape and murder, the Supreme Courtapplied formula of Swami Shraddhananda case as approved in Sriharancase. The deathsentencewas substituted withimprisonment forlifewith a direction that no remission shall be granted to the appellant and he shall remain in prison for rest of hislife. In case of Sudam alias Rahul Kaniram Jadhav Vs. State of Maharashtrareported in (2019) 9 S C C 388, where the accused was convicted for murder of 4 children and wife, the Supreme Courtsubstituted deathsentencewithlifeimprisonment without remission. In case of Sachin Kumar Singhraha Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh Page - 36 of 37 reported in (2019) 8 S C C 371, where the accused was convicted for rape and murder of a young child taking into account aggravating and mitigating circumstances, deathsentencewas commuted tosentenceoflifeimprisonment with a minimum 25 years ofimprisonment without remission. In case of Parsuram Vs. State of Madhya Pradeshreported in (2019) 8 S C C 382, where the accused was convicted for rape and murder of a child by her tutor, taking into account mitigating and aggravating circumstances deathsentencewas commuted toimprisonment of 30 years without remission.

    "text": "Palanisamy And Chinnasamy @ Vakkil, ... vs State Rep. By Inspector Of Police on 20 July, 2006 18. Having regard to the expression used in Section 2(1), namely, any offence punishable with \"imprisonment\"; \" and in lieu of passing a \"sentenceofimprisonment\" under Section 8, the question that comes up for consideration is whether the termimprisonment mentioned in the above two sections would include \"imprisonment forlife\" or \"imprisonment simpliciter\". Mr. R. Sankarasubbu, learned Counsel appearing for the appellants by relying upon the judgment of the Supreme Courtreported in 1985 S C C ( Crl.) 280 ( Bhagirathi v. Delhi Administration) would contend that the term \"imprisonment\" found under Section 2(1)and Section 8 of the Tamilnadu Borstal Schools Act would includesentenceof \"imprisonment forlife\" and therefore, in this case though appellant No. 2 standssentencedto undergoimprisonment forlife, having regard to the law laid down in the above referred to judgment, this Courtwould be in a position to exercise the power available under Section 8 of the Tamilnadu Borstal Schools Act in favour of Appellant No. 2. The judgment of the Supreme Courtis by a Constitution Bench. We carefully went through the above referred to judgment. A question arose before the Supreme Courtin that judgment as to whether \"set off\" provided under Section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is available only to a person, who has beensentencedto \"imprisonment for a term\" or would it include a person, who had beensentencedto \"imprisonment forlife\". In other words the question that was called upon to be decided by the Supreme Courtwas whether the expression \"imprisonment for a term\" found in Section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would include \"imprisonment forlife\" as well. In the case before the Supreme Court, the facts are as here under:20. In Vallabhapuram Ravi's case, referred to supra, a similar provision like Tamilnadu Borstal Schools Act, namely, Andhra Pradesh Borstal Schools Actwas under consideration. It is not in dispute that the provisions of Andhra Act are in pari-materia with the Tamilnadu Act. The facts availablein that caseare the convict prisoner, on being found guilty of the offence of murder wassentencedto undergoimprisonment forlife. The Supreme Courthad dealt with in that judgment in great detail as to how Law to protect children, on being found guilty of offence, was evolved. The State Governmentin that caseexercising power under Section 10- A of that Act (in parimateria to the Tamilnadu Act) directed the detention of the convict prisoner in a school. Though he has crossed the upper age limit prescribed under the Act, he was not released from the school and therefore he moved the High Courtof Andhra Pradesh for an appropriate relief and a writ was issued directing his release. The State of Andhra Pradesh went up in appeal to the Supreme Court. The point which weighed with the State Government in not releasing the convict prisoner from the school, though he has crossed the upper age limit, was the impact of Section 433- Aof the Code of Criminal Procedure. Considering the scope and impact of Section 433- Aof the Code of Criminal Procedure on the benevolent provision of the Andhra Pradesh Borstal Schools Act 1925, the Supreme Courtheld that despite the introduction of Section 433- Aof the Code of Criminal Procedure, yet the right, which an adolescent offender gets under the Andhra Pradesh Borstal Schools Act, would not be taken away and therefore it sustained the order of the Andhra Pradesh High Courtin directing the release of the adolescent offender. It must be noticed here that in the above referred to case decided by the Supreme Court, there was an order in favour of the adolescent offender passed by the State Government exercising their power under Section 10- Aof the Andhra Pradesh Borstal Schools Act. Of course, this judgment overrules the judgment of this Courtreported in 1982 Law Weekly ( Cri.) 217 ( Ganapathy, In re). In the context of the above, we immediately went through the judgment of this Courtin Ganapathi's case to find out on what point of law, this Court's judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court. This Courtin the above referred to judgment held that an adolescent offender sent to a Borstal School under the Tamilnadu Borstal Schools Act, after the expiry of his detention in the Borstal School, must serve the residue ofimprisonment in the prison. This conclusion was based on Section 433- Aof the Code of Criminal Procedure. Only to that extent, the Supreme Courtin Vallabhapuram Ravi's case overruled the judgment of this Court. We will refer in great detail at a later stage in this judgment what is the Lawlaid down bythis Courtin Ganapathi's case and it's effect on the issue pending before us. In Bhoop Ram's case referred to supra, once again we find that Uttar Pradesh Children Actwas under consideration. We had already noted the provisions of Uttar Pradesh Children Actin one of the earlier cases of the Supreme Courtreferred to above. In Bhoop Ram's case also it was found that the convict prisoner was a child and therefore he ought not to have beensentencedtoimprisonment but ought to have been sent only to an approved school. The Courtproceeded to hold that since the convict prisoner had crossed the upper age limit/the maximum period of detention in the approved school, it had no other go except to quash thesentenceand release the convict prisoner forthwith. Jayendra's case was noted in this judgment. On facts we will have to state that the provisions of the Tamilnadu Borstal Schools Act are totally different from the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Children Act. 18. Having regard to the expression used in Section 2(1), namely, any offence punishable with \"imprisonment\"; \" and in lieu of passing a \"sentenceofimprisonment\" under Section 8, the question that comes up for consideration is whether the termimprisonment mentioned in the above two sections would include \"imprisonment forlife\" or \"imprisonment simpliciter\".

This would only be a reassertion of the Constitution bench decision in Bachan Singh, besides being in accordance with the modern trends in penology.\"60. In Dilip Prem Narayan Tiwari vs. State of Maharastra, A I R 2010 S C 36, the Supreme Court, reducing thesentenceto that oflifeimprisonment for 25 years clearly held that multiple murder itself would not be sufficient for imposing deathsentenceand selecting thesentencethe nature of crime, background of criminal, his mind set in the commission of offence and social status are relevant factors. Subsequent decisions show that the Supreme Courthas followed the Shradhanand pattern and has substitutedlifeimprisonment for rest oflife. For instance, in Sebastian vs. State of Kerala, (2010) 1 S C C 58 where the accused was previously convicted for the offence u/s 354 and further for the offenceu/s 363,376,379,302 and 201 I P C for rape and murder of young child and was awardedlifeimprisonment and he was facing trial for the murder of several children, was awarded deathsentenceand hissentencewas reduced tolifeimprisonment for rest oflifeon the ground that the case was based on circumstantial evidence and the accused was a young man of 24 years at the time of incident. In Vikram Singh v State of Punjab, (2010) 3 S C C 56 three accused persons were awarded deathsentencefor kidnapping and murder for ransom. The Supreme Courtupheld thesentencein respect of two accused persons but converted thesentenceintolifefor the third accused.62. In Sandeep v State of U P, (2012) 6 S C C 107, the accused wassentencedwith death penalty which was upheld by the Allahabad High Court. The Supreme Court, while upholding the conviction of the accused Sandeep, converted the deathsentencetolifeimprisonment with the condition that the main culprit Sandeep would serve minimumimprisonment for 30 years without remissions during the said period. The co-accused was ordered to serveimprisonment for minimum 20 years without remission. Again, in Union of India v V. Sriharanalias Murugan, (2016) 7 S C C 1, the Shradhanand pattern was affirmed on a Reference made by the Courtin Union of India v V. Sriharanalias Murugan, 2014 (11) S C C 1 in respect of remission the state was inclined to grant and release the assailants of Rajiv Gandhi.

It was remarked that the Courtmay \"alter the said punishment (deathsentence) with one either for the entirety of the convict'slifeor for any specific period of more than 14 years, say 20, 30 or so on depending upon the gravity of the crime committed and the exercise of judicial conscience befitting such offence found proved to have been committed.\"63. Similarly, Raj Kumar v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2014) 5 S C C 353, a case concerning the rape and murder of a 14 years old girl, the Courtdirected the appellant therein to serve a minimum of 35 years in jail without remission. In Selvam v. State, (2014) 12 S C C 274, the Courtimposed asentenceof 30 years in jail without remission in a case concerning the rape of a 9 yearold girl. In Tattu Lodhi v. State of M P, (2016) 9 S C C 675, where the accused was found guilty of committing the murder of a minor girl aged 7 years, the Courtimposed thesentenceofimprisonment forlifewith a direction not to release the accused from prison till he completed the period of 25 years ofimprisonment. Similar approach has been adopted in Parsuram v State of M P, (2019) 8 S C C 382. Recently, in Sachin Kumar Singhraha v State of M P, (2019) 8 S C C 371, where the accused wassentencedcapital punishment for the offence of rape and murder of 5 years girl, the Supreme Courtconverted thesentenceintolifeimprisonment for 25 years without remission and has observed: \".......the formalization of special category ofsentence, though for an extremely few number of cases, shall have the great advantage of having the death penalty on the statute book but to actually use it as little as possible, really in the rarest of rare cases.

Appeal No.1484/2004 before this Courtchallenging the conviction entered and thesentencepassed against them. As per judgment dated 29.10.2007, this Courtdismissed the appeal, confirming the conviction entered and thesentencepassed. The 2 nd petitioner herein ( A 3) preferred S. L. P( Crl.) No.4749 of 2009 before the Supreme Courtof India challenging the judgment passed by this Court. As per order dated 7.07.2009, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtof India dismissed the S. L. P on the ground of delay as also on merits. Eventhough the 2 nd petitioner preferred a review petition as Review Petition ( Crl.) No.656 of 2009 in S. L. P( Crl.) No.4749/2009 contending that by virtue of the statutory mandate under Section 427(2) Cr. P. C, the substantivesentenceofimprisonment under Section 449 I P C should have been directed to run only concurrently and not consecutively with thesentenceofimprisonment forlife, the said Review Petition was dismissed by the Supreme Courton 9.12.2009. It is thereafter that the petitioners have filed the present petition under Section 482 Cr. P. C seeking the aforesaid direction.9. In Ranjith Singh v. Union Terittory of Chandigarh - A I R 1991 S C 2296), Ranjith Singh was earlier convicted for murder and was awardedimprisonment forlife. He committed a second murder within a span of one year of his earlier conviction at a time when he was released on parole. For the second murder committed by him he wassentencedto death. He challenged his second conviction andsentencebefore the Supreme Courtwhich disposed of his appeal in the decision reported in A I R 1984 S C 45. The Supreme Courtcommuted the deathsentenceof Ranjith Singh (who was already alifeconvict) toimprisonment forlife. But the Apex Courtordered that the secondlifeimprisonment shall not run concurrently with his earlierlifeimprisonment and directed that in case any remission or commutation in respect of his earliersentencewas granted to him, then the secondlifesentenceshall commence only thereafter. Seven years thereafter Ranjith Singh challenged the above direction of the Supreme Courtby filing a writ petition before the Supreme Courtitself under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. He contended that the aforesaid direction of the Supreme Courtmade in the year 1984 was contrary to the mandate under Section 427(2) Cr. P. C as per which the 2 ndlifesentencecould only run concurrently. Treating the said writ petition as a petition for clarification, the Supreme Courtin A I R 1991 S C 2296 held that the above direction made in the year 1984 by the Supreme Courtwas to be so construed as to harmonise withsection 427(2) Cr. P. C and clarified that the secondlifeimprisonment awarded to Ranjith Singh would run concurrently with his earlierlifesentenceand that the secondlifeimprisonment would remain unaffected by any remission or commutation given in respect of his earlierlifeimprisonment. In paragraph 8 of the above decision the Apex Courtlaid emphasis on the fact that unlikesection 427(1) Cr. P. C, nocourtdirection is necessary to make thesentencerun concurrently under Section 427(2) Cr. P. C. The Apex Courtthus virtually reversed its own earlier direction made seven years ago to the effect that the secondsentenceofimprisonment forlifeawarded to Ranjith Singh shall not run concurrently and clarified that the secondlifeimprisonment would run only concurrently and not consecutively. The petitioners preferred Crl. Appeal No.1484/2004 before this Courtchallenging the conviction entered and thesentencepassed against them. As per judgment dated 29.10.2007, this Courtdismissed the appeal, confirming the conviction entered and thesentencepassed. The 2 nd petitioner herein ( A 3) preferred S. L. P( Crl.) No.4749 of 2009 before the Supreme Courtof India challenging the judgment passed by this Court. As per order dated 7.07.2009, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtof India dismissed the S. L. P on the ground of delay as also on merits. Eventhough the 2 nd petitioner preferred a review petition as Review Petition ( Crl.) No.656 of 2009 in S. L. P( Crl.) No.4749/2009 contending that by virtue of the statutory mandate under Section 427(2) Cr. P. C, the substantivesentenceofimprisonment under Section 449 I P C should have been directed to run only concurrently and not consecutively with thesentenceofimprisonment forlife, the said Review Petition was dismissed by the Supreme Courton 9.12.2009. It is thereafter that the petitioners have filed the present petition under Section 482 Cr. P. C seeking the aforesaid direction.",

Of course, the material on record shows that if the pre-conviction detentions and the remissions earned by petitioners Nos. 1 and 2 are taken into consideration, the total period of detention would well be beyond 14 years.39. But the moot question would be whether the petitioners would be entitled to ask the Courtto take into consideration their pre-conviction detentions and the remissions earned by them to calculate the mandatory minimum of 14 years enacted in S. 433 A of the Code.40. In Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra, , the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Courtheld that a prisonersentencedtolifeimprisonment is bound to serve the remainder of hislifein Prison unless thesentenceimposed upon him is remitted or commuted by the appropriate Government. The Supreme Courtfurther heldin the said case that since such asentencecould not be equated with any fixed term, the Rules framed under the Prison Actentitled such a person to earn remissions but that, such remissions were to be taken into account only towards the end of the term. As observed earlier, the appropriate Government in exercise of the power conferred on it under S. 432 of the Code may remit the whole or any part of the punishment to which a person has beensentenced. The appropriate Government in exercise of the power given to it under S. 433 of the Code, inter alia, may commute thesentenceof Imprisonment for Lifetoimprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years or to fine.41. Indeed, in view of the decision of the Supreme Courtin Bhagirath v. Delhi Administration; and Rakesh Kaushik v. Delhi Administration, , both the petitioners would be entitled to set off of period of detention undergirt by them as under-trial prisoners, but they would be so entitled subject to the provisions of S. 433 A and provided the appropriate Government or the competent authority passes an order either under S. 432 or S. 433 of the Code.42. In Maru Ram's case , the Supreme Court, pointing out the distention between prisons and prisoners on the one hand andsentencesand their executions, remissions and commutation on the other, has pronounced that the Remission Schemes cannot be read as upsettingsentencebut as merely providing rewards and remissions for in-prison good conduct and the like and that if thesentenceis Life Imprisonment, remissions as such cannot help. The, law laid down by the Supreme Courtis that S. 433 A not only excludes S. 432 and subjects operation of s. 433(a) to serious restriction, but also excludes all contrary Prison Rules in respect of convicts contemplated by it. 38. Of course, the material on record shows that if the pre-conviction detentions and the remissions earned by petitioners Nos. 1 and 2 are taken into consideration, the total period of detention would well be beyond 14 years.39.

In other words, deathsentencemust be imposed only whenlifeimprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstance of the crime and provided and only provided, the option to imposesentenceofimprisonment forlifecannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances, and (iv) a balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.[2023/ R J J P/003860] (24 of 26) [ C R L D R-4/2021] 42 The Hon'ble Supreme Courtin Machhi Singh vs State of Punjab, (1983) 3 S C C 470, while following its earlier dictum in Bachan Singh's case held thatlifeimprisonment is the rule and deathsentenceis an exception. Apart from guidelines in Bachan Singh's case, the Supreme Courtin Machhi Singh's case in paras 33 and 34 additionally observed that in making a choice between the death penalty and that oflifeimprisonment, the Courthas also to take into consideration manner and motive of commission of murder. We reproduce paras 33 and 34 of the judgment of Supreme Courtin Machhi Singh in extenso:- 39. In Bantu v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2001) 9 S C C 615, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtconverted the deathsentenceawarded to the accused toimprisonment forlife. The accused was a 22 year old man who had raped and murdered a 6 year old child. It was acknowledged that the rape and murder was heinous, but the Apex Courttook into account that the accused had no previous criminal record and that he would not be a grave danger [2023/ R J J P/003860] (22 of 26) [ C R L D R-4/2021] to society at large. On this basis, the death penalty was converted tolifeimprisonment. This is what was said:",

    "text": "For Complainant - Mr. Saubhagya Ketan ... vs State Of Nct Of Delhi : 2002 (5) Scc 234; ... on 5 October, 2010 33. Sub- Section (3) of Section 354 of the Code provides that whenever the Courtawards deathsentencefor the offence which has alternative punishment forimprisonment forlifeor deathsentence, the special reasons for suchsentenceare to be stated. Such provision was considered by the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Courtin Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, A I R 1980 S C 898 and it was held that such provision makes a significant shift in the legislative policy underlying the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, according to which both alternativesentenceof death orimprisonment forlifeprovide for murder and for certain other capital offences under the Penal Code were normalsentence. Now, according to this changed legislative policy, which is patent on the face of Section 354 (3)of the Code, the normal punishment for murder and six other capital offences under the Penal Code isimprisonment forlife(orimprisonment for a term of years) and a death penalty is an exception. While considering the question ifsections 302, I. P. C. and 354 (3) of the Code are ultra vires of the Constitution of India, the Supreme Courtin the aforesaid case has held that death penalty is not unconstitutional. However, it should be inflicted only in the rarest of rare cases. However, the Hon'ble Supreme Courthas pointed out that no standardization can be made in which such severest of punishment can be imposed, the reasons being; Keeping such observations in mind and the various judicial pronouncements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the deathsentenceawarded to Aloke Nath was commuted toimprisonment forlife.38. The propriety of inflicting death penalty again came for consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Courtin Swamy Shraddananda alias Murali Manohar Mishra v. State of Karnataka, A I R 2007 S C 2531; wherein Hon'ble Justice S. B. Sinha took the view that the person accused of rape and murder of a minor girl, keeping in facts of the case in view, is to be punished withimprisonment forlifeinstead of the death penalty. The main reason behind such an opinion, in a case it is based only on circumstantial evidence, is reflected in paragraph 89 which we consider appropriate to quote. Further, in the said case, the Hon'ble Justice Markandey Katju did not agree with the conclusions reached by Hon'ble Justice Sinha. The matter was then referred to a Larger Bench. A Bench consisting of three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Courtin Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar Mishra v. State of Karnataka, reported in 2008 Crl. Law Journal 3911 endorsed the view taken by Hon'ble Shri Justice Sinha and thesentenceof death was commuted toimprisonment forlife.39. In the reference case of Swamy Shraddananda, the Larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Courthas held that the deathsentenceshould be substituted by thelifeimprisonment or by term in excess of 14 years and further directed that the convict must not be released from the prison for the rest of hislifeor for the actual term as specified in the order, as the case may be. Hence, the order was accordingly passed. The reason behind such conclusion is that when an appellant comes to the Supreme Courtcarrying a deathsentenceawarded by the trialcourtand confirmed by the High Court, the Supreme Courtmay find as in the present appeal that the case just falls short of the rarest of the rare category and may feel somewhat reluctant in endorsing the deathsentence. But at the same time, having regard to the nature of the crime, thecourtmay strongly feel that asentenceoflifeimprisonment which, subject to remission, normally works out to a term of 14 years would be grossly disproportionate and inadequate. If in such cases the Court's option is limited only to two punishments, one asentenceofimprisonment, for all intents and purposes of not more than 14 years and the other death, thecourtmay feel tempted and find itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty. Such a course would indeed be disastrous. It is further laid down that a far more just, reasonable and proper course would be to expand the options and to take over what, as a matter of fact, lawfully belongs to the Court, i.e. the vast hiatus between 14 years'imprisonment and death. 33. Sub- Section (3) of Section 354 of the Code provides that whenever the Courtawards deathsentencefor the offence which has alternative punishment forimprisonment forlifeor deathsentence, the special reasons for suchsentenceare to be stated. Such provision was considered by the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Courtin Bachan Singh v.

The Hon'ble Judges though upheld conviction of the accused but differed on the question ofsentencewith only one of them concurring with the judgment of the High Courtconfirming death penalty, another Hon'ble Judge observing that instead of deathsentence,sentenceof rigorousimprisonment forlifewill meet the ends of justice. The matter was therefore referred to a larger bench. A three judge bench of the Supreme Courtin Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod (2) Vs. State of Gujarat(2011) 2 S C C 764, answered the reference by favouringlifeimprisonment. In doing so, their Lordships concurred with the view expressed in earlier two Supreme Courtjudgments, namely, Ramraj Vs. State of Chhattisgarh(2010) 1 S C C 573 and Mulla and Another Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (2010) 3 S C C 508, and held that deathsentenceawarded to the accused shall stand commuted tolifeimprisonment which shall extend to the fulllifeof the appellant but subject to any remission or commutation at the instance of the Government for good and sufficient reasons. The Supreme Courtin Machhi Singh's case, supra, while following its earlier dictum in Bachan Singh's case, supra, held thatlifeimprisonment is the rule and deathsentenceis an exception, to which guidelines we have already made reference hereinabove. Apart from guidelines in Bachan Singh's case,referred to above, the Supreme Courtin Machhi Singh's case, supra, in Para 33 and 34 additionally observed that in making a choice between the death penalty and that oflifeimprisonment, thecourthas also to take into consideration manner and motive of commission of murder. We reproduce hereunder Para 33 and 34 of the judgment of Supreme Courtin Machhi Singh, supra, in extenso:- (4) When the crime is enormous in proportion. For instance when multiple murders, say of all or almost all the members of a family or a large number of persons of a particular caste, community, or locality, are committed.(5) When the victim of murder is an innocent child, or a helpless woman or old or infirm person or a person vis-`-vis whom the murderer is in a dominating position, or a public figure generally loved and respected by the community. In a recent judgment in Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod Vs. State of Gujarat(2009) 5 S C C 740, judgment of High Courtconfirming deathsentenceawarded to the appellant was challenged before the Supreme Court. The appellantin that casewas convicted for offence under Sections 363,366,376,397 and 302 of the I P C. The matter was laid before two- Judges bench of the Supreme Court.

    "text": "Sendhaji Mathurji And Ors. vs State Of Gujarat And Ors. on 1 August, 1980 8. The first decision is of the Supreme Courtin Gopal Vinayak Godse ` The Stale of Maharashtra and Ors. 63 Born. L. R. 517-. It is a decision of the five learned Judges of the Supreme Court. The first question which the Supreme Courthas answered in that decision is whether there is any provision of law under which asentenceoflifeimprisonment, without any formal order of remission by the appropriate Government, can be automatically treated as one for a definite period. The answer which the Supreme Courthas given is that there is no such provision in Indian Penal Codeor in the Code of Criminal Procedureor in the Prisons Act. Section 57 of the Indian Penal Code has been referred to in that case. In that connection, it has been observed by the Supreme Courtthat it has no bearing on the question because only for the purpose of calculating fractions of the terms of punishment, Section 57 provides that transportation (orimprisonment) forlifeshall be regarded as equivalent toimprisonment for twenty years. It does not say that transportation shall be deemed to be transportation for twenty years for all purposes. It has been further observed by the Supreme Courtthat the amended section which substitutes the words \"imprisonment forlife\" for \"transportation forlife\" does not enable them to draw any such all-embracing inference. Asentenceofimprisonment forlifemust prima facie be treated asimprisonment for the whole of the remaining period of the convicted person's naturallife. An argument was also raised that Bombay rules governing the remission system substitute a definite period forlifeimprisonment and that, therefore, if the aggregate of the term actually served exceeded the said period, the prisoner would be entitled to be released. In order to answer that contention, the Supreme Courtexamined Rule 934, Rule 937(c), Rule 1419(c) and Rule 1447(2) of the Bombay Rules made under the Prisons Act, 1874. The Supreme Courthas observed that they are statutory rules. However, the Prisoners Act under which they are made does not confer on any authority a power to commute or remitsentence. It provides only for the regulation of prisons and for the treatment of prisoners confined therein. Section 59 inter alia confers power on the State Government to make rules, for rewards for good conduct. Therefore, the rules made under the Act should be construed within the scope of that Act. For the purpose of working out the remissions under those rules, transportation (orimprisonment) forlifeis ordinarily to be taken as 15 years' actualimprisonment. In the opinion of the Supreme Court, Rule 1419(c) could not be construed as a statutory equation of 15 years' actualimprisonment for transportation forlife. The equation which that rules lays down is only for a particular purpose, namely, for the purpose of \"remission system\" and not for all purposes. The Supreme Courthas also referred to the non obstante Clause in Rule 1447(2) and observed that notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 1419 no prisoner who has beensentencedto transportation forlifeshall be released on completion of his term unless orders of the Government have been received on a report submitted to it. The Supreme Courthas, therefore, drawn the inference that 15 yearsimprisonment specified in Rule 1419(c) is only for the purpose of calculating the remissions and that the completion of the term ofimprisonment on that basis does not ipso facto confer any right upon the prisoner to be released. Proceeding further, the Supreme Courthas observed that the order of the Government contemplated in Rule 1447 in the case of a prisonersentencedto transportation forlifecan only be an order under Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for, in the case of asentenceof transportation forlifethe release of the prisoner can legally be effected only by remitting the entire balance of thesentence. Under the rules, the orders of an appropriate Government under Section 401, Criminal Procedure Code, are a pre-requisite for such a release. It has been observed by the Supreme Courtthat no rule was brought to the notice of that Courtwhich confers an indefeasible right on a prisonersentencedto transportation forlifeto an unconditional release on the expiry of a particular term including remissions. The rules under the Prisons Actdo not substitute a lessersentencefor asentenceof transportation forlife. After having examined different Clauses and correlated them, the legal position has been summed up by the Supreme Courtin the following words:",

Since the mercy petition was still pending, the petition was dismissed in liming by the Supreme Courton 14 th April, 1987 as being premature. Ultimately, on 16 th December 1988, the petitioner was informed that his mercy petition has been rejected by the President.(9) In Sadhu Singh vs. State of U.

P. vs. Sahai, , the Supreme Courtwhile holding that the murders were extremely gruesome, brutal and dastardly, nonetheless declined to pass thesentenceof death on the ground that more than 8 years had elapsed since the occurrence.(29) Before parting with the petition, we may express our concern and displeasure on the working of the Departing dealing with the mercy petitions. Time over again, it has been brought to the notice of the Government that any inordinate delay in the disposal of the mercy petition of a condemned prisoner can be taken serious note of by thecourts. Asentenceof death of many of the prisoners has been reduced toimprisonment forlifeon that score. In the case of Hermans Singh vs. Up and others, ( C W P 7453/81) (14) the Supreme Courtallowed the revision petition and reduced thesentenceof death imposed upon the petitioner toimprisonment forlifeon the short ground that even after remand, the President failed to reconsider the mercy petition within a reasonable time, while disposing of the petition, the Courtobserved : \" It cannot be too eloquently and emphatically emphasised that there is imperative urgency in matters concerninglifeand death. We would have been happier and the petitioner Harbans Singh could have been spared the pangs of the death cell if the Government had responded to our recommendation within a reasonable time. That time has passed by any lest. Accordingly, we reduce thesentenceof death imposed upon the petitioner toimprisonment forlife.\" In order to avoid suchlike delays, it is desirable that the Department should maintain the record of chronological dates of the events which have a bearing on the dispersal of the petitioner and the steps taken from the date the mercy petition is received. There should also be a periodical review of the cases as to why the delay is being caused, by the concerned authorities. This would obviate the possibility of any undue delay in the disposal of the mercy petition, in future. (2) After few days, the petitioner sent a mercy petition to the President of India. When more than two years elapsed in the disposal of his mercy petition, the petitioner approached the Supreme Courtby way of writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India seeking the issuance of an appropriate writ, order or direction to quash thesentenceof death and substituting in its place asentenceofimprisonment forlife.

    "text": "The State vs Aru Pradhan on 2 July, 1984 The Supreme Courthas observed in Ummilal v. State of Madhya Pradeshthat when murder has been committed under a sudden impulse in a grave fit of rage, ends of justice would be met bysentencingthe accused toimprisonment forlife. Referring to the case of Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab 1980 Cri L J 636, the Supreme Courthas observed in 1983(1) Crimes 784 : 1983 Cri L J 846, Erabhadrappa v. State of Karnataka that thesentenceof death should not be passed except in the rarest of the rare cases.37. For passing thesentenceof death, reference has been made by the learned Sessions Judge to the case (supra). In that case, however, the appellant had committed multiple murdersand robberyand the Supreme Courthad observed that no ground for substituting thesentenceoflifeimprisonment for death could be perceived. According to the Supreme Court, it was truly the rarest of the rare cases and accordingly the deathsentencewas confirmed.38. In our view, the case before us is one of the many cases which one comes across where murders have been committed owing to land disputes. The prosecution had sought to build its case as if it was one of conspiracy between the appellant and his mother (acquitted co-accused). The case of the prosecution and the evidence led in its support was that on the day prior to the fateful day of occurrence, the co-accused had threatened by saying that the deceased would be killed on the day of occurrence, it was alleged. When the deceased was moving on the village road, the co-accused instigated the appellant to kill her. This part of the prosecution case as against the co-accused has not been accepted by the trial Court. Having lost in the litigation against the deceased and with a sense of frustration and despair, the appellant appears to have taken the opportunity of killing the deceased on the spur of the moment when she was moving on the village road. There was no evidence that the appellant was aware of the fact that the deceased was then pregnant. The offence appears to have been committed by the appellant in moments of emotional disturbance. Killing is cruel and, therefore, all murders are cruel. But such cruelty may vary in its degree of culpability and it is only when the culpability assumes the proportion of extreme depravation that special reasons can legitimately be said to exist for passing the extreme penalty of the law, as observed in (supra). The act of the appellant has not been committed after previous planning and does not, in our view, involve exceptional depravity. Ends of justice can be met in a case bysentencingan accused toimprisonment forlifewhen the murder has been committed under a sudden impulse in a grave fit of rage, as has been done in the instant case by the appellant when he saw the deceased, who had succeeded in her litigation against him, moving on the village road. Deathsentenceis to be imposed only whenlifeimprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment. The act of murder committed by the appellant was not something uncommon. What seems to have prompted the mind of the appellant is not immediate gain by the commission of the murder, but his sense of frustration and disappointment in connection with the litigation between him and the deceased. There are no special reasons, in our view, for imposing the deathsentence. We are, therefore, of the view that it would meet the ends of justice if instead ofsentencingthe appellant to death, he issentencedto undergoimprisonment forlife. The Supreme Courthas observed in Ummilal v. State of Madhya Pradeshthat when murder has been committed under a sudden impulse in a grave fit of rage, ends of justice would be met bysentencingthe accused toimprisonment forlife. Referring to the case of Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab 1980 Cri L J 636, the Supreme Courthas observed in 1983(1) Crimes 784 : 1983 Cri L J 846, Erabhadrappa v.

    "text": "Virabasayya Prabhayya Hallur And Anr. vs State Of Karnataka on 14 January, 2003 7. Section 379 is a new section introduced in the 1973 Act. The Law Commission in its 41 st Report recommended that where a person has been acquitted by the Trial Courtof a capital offence and on appeal the High Courtfinds him guilty butsentenceshim toimprisonment forlifeinstead of death, he should have a right of appeal to the Supreme Court, since there is no justification for restricting the right of appeal to cases where deathsentenceis awarded. But, this right is not extended to the cases where the accused issentencedtoimprisonment for 10 years or for a lesser period. Clause 389 of the Bill as drafted provides that where the High Courtsentenceda person toimprisonment forlifein an appeal against his acquittal, an appeal should lie to the Supreme Court. As recommended by the Joint Select Committee, an amendment was made to bring it in line with the provisions of the Supreme Court( Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970.8. However, the Apex Courtin the case of Podda Narayana and Ors. v State of Andhra Pradesh, observed that since the High Courthad awarded thesentenceoflifeimprisonment after reversing the order of acquittal passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, appeal to the Supreme Courtlies even on facts and as a matter of right under Section 2 of the Supreme Court( Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970. In the case of Ram Kamar Panda v State of Madhya Pradesh, the Apex Courtheld that no certificate of the High Courtis required for such an appeal where an acquittal has been converted into a conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the I P C and asentenceoflifeimprisonment imposed upon an accused person. The appeal in such a case, lies as a matter of right to the Supreme Courtunder the Act of 1970. Similar view is also expressed by the Apex Courtin a catena of decisions. In the cases of Chandra Mohan Tiwari and Anr. v State of Madhya Pradesh, and in Makwana Takhat Singh Ratan Singh v State of Gujarat, the Apex Courtheld that under Section 379 which is in line with Article 134(1)(a)and (b) of the Constitution, an appeal lies as of right to the Supreme Courtin a case where the High Courthas on appeal reversed an order of acquittal and has convicted andsentencedthe accused either to death orimprisonment forlifeorimprisonment for a term of 10 years or more. Therefore, the position of law that where the High Courtreverses an order of acquittal passed by the Session Judge and convicted an accused and passedsentenceofimprisonment of death orsentenceoflifeimprisonment of 10 years or more, is appealable as of right either under Section 379 or under Article 134(1)(a)and (b) of the Constitution of India, is the settled position. Therefore, this question is no longer in dispute. The controversy is in respect of the remedy or relief provided to an accused person whose acquittal by the Trial Courtis reversed by the High Courtandsentencedfor a period of less than 3 years in which case whether an accused who suffered thissentenceof less than 3 years is entitled for suspension ofsentencepending appeal and for bail under Section 389(1) and (3) of the Cr. P. C. Section 389 reads as follows: 7. Section 379 is a new section introduced in the 1973 Act. The Law Commission in its 41 st Report recommended that where a person has been acquitted by the Trial Courtof a capital offence and on appeal the High Courtfinds him guilty butsentenceshim toimprisonment forlifeinstead of death, he should have a right of appeal to the Supreme Court, since there is no justification for restricting the right of appeal to cases where deathsentenceis awarded. But, this right is not extended to the cases where the accused issentencedtoimprisonment for 10 years or for a lesser period. Clause 389 of the Bill as drafted provides that where the High Courtsentenceda person toimprisonment forlifein an appeal against his acquittal, an appeal should lie to the Supreme Court. As recommended by the Joint Select Committee, an amendment was made to bring it in line with the provisions of the Supreme Court( Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970.",

    "text": "Parveen Kumar vs State Of Punjab on 23 March, 1979 3. If the High Courtdealing with an appeal from the judgment of the Sessions Courtin the second murder case finds that thesentenceoflifeimprisonment in the first murder case which was in operation at the time of the decision by the Sessions Court, has been set aside by a higher Court, it shall have to take the subsequent events of acquittal into consideration and on account of the same, Section 303, Indian Penal Code, would cease to have application; and 4. It may so happen that the Court( Supreme Court) seized of an appeal against the High Courtjudgment may find when it records its own judgment that thesentenceoflifeimprisonment, imposed by the trial Court, but set aside by a higher Court, has been re-imposed in a further proceeding. In that event, the Supreme Courtshall have to proceed on the basis that at the time when the accused is alleged to have committed murder, he was under asentenceofimprisonment forlife. If the conviction for murder is upheld by the Supreme Court, Section 303, Indian Penal Code, would come into play and the accused shall have to besentencedto death. Lastly, the scope of Section 303, Indian Penal Code, was interpreted in para 13 as under: Thus, when Section 303 speaks of a person undersentenceofimprisonment forlife, it means a person under an operative, executablesentenceofimprisonment forlife. Asentenceonce imposed but later set aside is not executable and therefore the Courtconvicting an accused of murder cannot take such asentenceinto account for imposing thesentenceof death by the application of Section 303.5. From the above discussion, it is clear that Chandrachud, J., clearly held that the expression \"undersentenceofimprisonment forlife\" under Section 303, Indian Penal Code, meant that the Court, whether at the Sessions trial, the Appellate Courtor the Supreme Courtin special leave while deciding the matter relating to the second murder was required to take into consideration the latest decision in the first murder. If thesentenceoflifeawarded in the first murder is not set aside at the time of the decision relating to the second murder, the same was to be taken into consideration as operative and executable and as such, the convict was to be treated as \"undersentenceofimprisonment forlife\". Even if conviction in the first murder case results in acquittal at the appellate stage, but again if thesentenceoflifeimprisonment is restored in appeal by the Supreme Court, the provision of Section 303, Indian Penal Code, will be attracted when the second murder case falls for determination before any Courtsubsequent thereto. As the High Courtof Madhya Pradesh had acquitted Rohitsingh in the first murder before deciding his appeal relating to the second murder, thelifesentenceunder the first murder had been obliterated for all purposes and it was held that Section 303, Indian Penal Code, was not applicable and the decision of the High Courtwas set aside. 3. If the High Courtdealing with an appeal from the judgment of the Sessions Courtin the second murder case finds that thesentenceoflifeimprisonment in the first murder case which was in operation at the time of the decision by the Sessions Court, has been set aside by a higher Court, it shall have to take the subsequent events of acquittal into consideration and on account of the same, Section 303, Indian Penal Code, would cease to have application; and 4. It may so happen that the Court( Supreme Court) seized of an appeal against the High Courtjudgment may find when it records its own judgment that thesentenceoflifeimprisonment, imposed by the trial Court, but set aside by a higher Court, has been re-imposed in a further proceeding. In that event, the Supreme Courtshall have to proceed on the basis that at the time when the accused is alleged to have committed murder, he was under asentenceofimprisonment forlife.

In the present case, that ratio would apply with full force because it is a case of suicidal death as no evidence of direct involvement of the accused-appellant Gajendra Singh is there though indirectly he may have been held responsible for such death. The Supreme Courtin G. V. Siddaramesh Vs.

It was held thatsentenceoflifeimprisonment was excessive considering that appellant was young and has already undergone six years ofimprisonment and in those facts,sentenceof ten years rigorousimprisonment was held sufficient to meet the ends of justice. The Supreme Courtin Smt. Shanti and another Vs. State of Haryana: (1991) S C C 1 371 also held that in a case where there is no evidence as to the cause of death and the actual part played by the accused, minimumsentenceof seven years rigorousimprisonment would be sufficient to meet the ends of justice and thus altered thesentenceoflifeimprisonment to seven years rigorousimprisonment. The Supreme Courtin Pathan Hussain Basha Vs.

In those circumstances, the Supreme Courtheld that ends of justice would be met if punishment oflifeimprisonment is reduced to ten years rigorousimprisonment. The Supreme Courtin Amar Singh Vs.

Ranjeet Singh submitted that accused has four young children to be locked after and it is submitted during trial of present case accused had to be taken to I H B A S for his mental disequilibrium and he deserves the lesser side ofsentenceawardable under Section 302 I P C. Ld. Addl. P P on the other hand pressed for deathsentencepointing out that killing of deceased by accused was in a brutal manner as repeated knife blows were inflicted and the left hand upto wrist and a finger of right hand were chopped off and this brutal killing was committed by accused in the presence of his young children, who are the eye witnesses of incident. I have given due consideration to both sides submissions. There are innumerable instances where offence of murder committed in a brutal manner has been dealt with by awardinglifeimprisonment and brutal killing by itself was found not to be sufficient reason to bring the case within the parameter of \"rarest of the rare case\". It has been held in C Muniyappan vs. State of Tamil Nadu, A I R 2010 S C 3718 that \"rarest of the rare case\" comes when convict would be a menace and threat to the peaceful existence of society. However, then a case where crime was committed in a brutal and diabolic manner, asentenceforlifeimprisonment specifying a particular term for thatlifeimprisonment is found dealt with in a case reported as Sri Bhagwan vs. State of Rajasthan, 2001 (6) S C C 296. Accusedin that casea young person aged around 20 killed five members of a family by mercilessly battering them to death and motive was theft of gold ornaments. Manner of killing was brutal and the circumstance exhibited gross ingratitude on the part of accused. Supreme Courtcommuted deathsentencetoimprisonment forlifewith a further direction that accused would not be released from prison until he served atleast 20 years ofimprisonment including period already undergone by him. Similarsentencewas found awardable to a accused in another case who killed his brother, mother and four other members of his brother's family as his demand for partition of property was being declined. While setting aside deathsentence Supreme Courtawarded asentenceoflifeimprisonment with a further direction that he will not be released until he served out atleast 20 years ofimprisonment ( Parkash Dhawal vs. State of Maharasthra, 2002(2) S C C 35).",

The learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently relied on the decision of the Honourable Supreme Courtin Maru Ram Case mentioned supra. In Maru Ramcase relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the Honourable Supreme Courthad an occasion to consider the scope and ambit of the amendments brought to Section 433- Aof the Code of Criminal Procedure, whereby a condition was imposed that the person who was imposed withlifesentenceor who was imposed with deathsentencebut subsequently suchsentencewas commuted tolifeimprisonment, shall not be released from prison unless he had served at least fourteen years ofimprisonment. The Honourable Supreme Courtalso considered the position that existed prior to the amendments being brought into Section 433- A of the ____________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis Code and whether those who weresentencedtolifeor death prior to amendment can still have to wait till they serve actual 14 years ofsentencefor their premature release in view of the amendments made.

Therefore, the contention urged on behalf of the petitioner that the Governor's approval or consent is not necessary and the petitioner can be released on the basis of the advice given by the Council of Minister on 09.09.2018 cannot be countenanced. In this context, we are fortified by the decision relied on by the learned Additional Solicitor General of India in the case of Registrar, High Courtof Madras vs. R. Rajiahmentioned supra. This decision was rendered by the Honourable Supreme Courtinterpreting Service Law jurisprudence. In that case, the respondent therein, a Judicial Officer, was imposed with a punishment of compulsory retirement by the High Court.

The Sessions Judge disbelieved all the eye-witnesses and acquit- ted the accused. On the other hand the High Courtrelied on the evidence of P W 9 as being corroborated by P Ws 1 and 10. The High Court, therefore, set aside the acquittal and convicted the accused undersection 302, Indian Penal Code, andsentencedhim to rigorousimprisonment forlife. Hence this appeal under section 2(a) of the Supreme Court( Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Act, 1970. P W 4 who lodged the first information report without naming any accused and who did not know the accused before the occurrence could not even identify him at the Test Identification Parade which was held on September 29, 1966. The evidence of P W 4 is, therefore, of no significance. The case, therefore, depended upon the evidence of recognition of the accused while running from the place of occurrence by P Ws 1, 10 and the direct testimony of P W 9 who knew the accused from before. The accused was known only to Sabir Hanfi ( P W 9) by name. The other two witnesses did not know the accused from before and saw him only while running away followed by twenty or twenty five other persons. The evidence of P Ws 1 and 10, which we have carefully perused, go to show that they did not know the accused from before. They however,.. identified the accused in the Test Identification Parade held on September 29, 1966, nearly six months after the occurrence. There is no reason why the Test Parade was delayed so long when the accused had surren- dered on June 17, 1966. As stated earlier, the trialcourtwhich had opportunity to see these witnesses disbelieved them by giving certain reasons. For example, according to the Sessions Judge, these two witnesses had the opportunity to know the accused from before and,. therefore, their identification in the Test Identification Parade was not considered of such significance. He further observed that these witnesses saw the accused at the time when he was running away from the place of occurrence and, therefore, \"it is highly improbable that they would be able to retain the impression of the assailant of Lala Barhi in their mind for so many months\". The High Court, on the other hand, held that identification by P Ws 1 and 10 was reliable. Thus when twocourtshave come to a different conclusion on the same evidence, we had ourselves to go through the entire evidence carefully in order to see whether the appreciation of the evidence by the Sessions Judge was so unreasonable anti unrealistic as to entitle the High Courtto interfere with the same.",

Now, the question arising for consideration is : Whether the punishment ofimprisonment forlifeawarded to appellant No.1 by the trialcourtis warranted in the instant case ? Section 304- B (2)of the I P C lays down that \" Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished withimprisonment for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may extend toimprisonment forlife.\" It has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Courtin Hem Chand v. State of Haryana, (1994) 6 Supreme Court Cases 727 that in every dowry death case, the extreme punishment ofimprisonment forlifeshould not be awarded. Since conviction under Section 304- B I P C is based upon presumption, therefore, awarding of extreme punishment ofimprisonment forlifeshould be used in rare cases and not in every case. In that case, thesentenceofimprisonment forlifeawarded to the accused under Section 304- B I P C was reduced to 10 years rigorousimprisonment. The same view was reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Courtin G. V. Siddaramesh v.

In the instant case, the un-natural death of Kamlesh was due to hanging. Appellant No.1 Mohinder Singh, who is aged about 35 years, has been convicted for the offence of dowry death, on the basis of presumption raised under Section 304- Bof the I P C read with Section 113- Bof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, as the prosecution has been able to establish all the ingredients of the offence of dowry death. Therefore, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the awarding ofsentenceof 10 years rigorousimprisonment to appellant No.1 would meet the ends of justice. Accordingly, while confirming his conviction under Section 304- B I P C, we reduce hissentenceofimprisonment forlifeto 10 years rigorousimprisonment.",

The Bihar Children Act, 1982 and the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 and that the Bihar Act had already been in force at the time of the commission of the offence. It took note of the decisions of this Courtin Bhoop Ram (supra) and Jayendra(supra) and emphasized that in these cases although the conviction was sustained thesentencehad been quashed taking into account the fact that the appellants had crossed the age of juvenility and could not be sent to an ‘approved school’ as had been contemplated under the relevant Children’s Act.

The Courthas observed that apart from various considerations which may weight with thecourt, one consideration which may be relevant in given circumstances, is the planned motivation that goaded the accused to commit the crime. Largely, in India death is caused not by a cool, calculated, professionally cold blooded planning but something that happened on the spur of the moment. In fact in faction-ridden society factions came to grip on a minor provocation and a gruesome tragedy occurs. Thecourtfurther observed that special reasons necessary for imposing death penalty must relate, not to the crime as such but to the criminal. The crime may be shocking and yet the criminal may not deserve death penalty. The crime may be less shocking than other murderer and yet the callous Crimainal e.g. a lethal economic offender, may be jeoopardizing societal existence by his act of murder. Likewise, a hardened murder or dacoit or armed robber who kills and relishes killing and raping and murdering to such an extent that he is beyond rehabilitation within a reasonable period according to current psychotherapy or curative techniques may deserve the terminalsentence. Society survives by security for Ordinarylife. If officers enjoined to defend the peace are treacherously killed to facrlitate perpetuation of murderous and often plunderous crimes social justice steps in to demand death penalty dependent on the totality of circumstances.\"",

P. on 21 July, 2000 However, we must make it clear that a second bail application would be maintainable only on some substantial ground where some point which has a strong bearing on the fate of the appeal and which may have the effect of reversing the order of conviction of the accused is made out. Apart from the ground on the merits of the case, a second application for bail would also be maintainable on the ground of unusual long delay in hearing of the appeal as in the event the appeal is not heard within a reasonable time and the convicted accused undergoes a major part of thesentenceimposed upon him, the purpose of filing of the appeal itself may be frustrated. The Apex Courtconsidered the question of grant of second bail application on the ground of delay in Kashmira Singh v. State of Punjab A I R 1977 S C 2147 : 1977 Cri L J 1746. In this case, the accused was tried for an offence of murder but he was convicted only under Section 323, I. P. C. by the trial Court. The appeal against acquittal preferred by the State was allowed by the High Courtand he was convicted under Section 302, I. P. C. and wassentencedtoimprisonment forlife. Thereafter he filed an appeal in the Supreme Courtwhere special leave was granted to him on 28-2-1974 but his prayer for bail was refused. After more than three years he filed a second bail application which was allowed on 2-9-1977 on the ground that as the Courtwas not in a position to hear the appeal within a reasonable period of time, it would be appropriate to release the applicant on bail in a case where special leave had been granted to the accused. Though the case is distinguishable on facts as the accused had been acquitted for the offence under Section 302, I. P. C. by the trial Courtbut had been convicted by the High Courtin an appeal against acquittal, nevertheless the principle for entertaining the second bail application on the ground of delay in hearing the appeal would be applicable here. A strong humanitarian ground which may not necessarily pertain to the accused himself but may pertain to someone very close to him may also, in certain circumstances, be a ground to entertain a second bail application. These are some of the grounds on which second bail application may be entertained. It is not only very difficult but hazardous to lay down the criteria on which a second application for bail may be maintainable as it will depend upon peculiar facts and circumstances of each case.",

The question with regard to prescribing the length of incarceration by thesentencingcourthas been considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Courtin various cases. Recently in Ramraj v. State of Chhattisgarh, (2010) 1 S C C 573, while considering the various precedents in this regard, including the decision in Swamy Shraddananda v. State of Karnataka, (2008) 13 S C C 767, the Supreme Courthas held thatlifeimprisonment is not to be interpreted as beingimprisonment for the whole of a convict's naturallifewithin the scope of Section 45 of the Code. In some cases, where on account of the brutal murder having been committed, deathsentencewas awarded by the trialcourtand reference was accepted by the High Court, the Supreme Court, while coming to the conclusion that the case does not fall within the definition of `the rarest of rare cases' which warrants deathsentence, reduced the deathsentencetolifeimprisonment. In those cases, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, claim of the prisoners for pre-mature release after a minimum incarceration for a period of 14 years, as envisaged under Section 433- A Cr. P. C., could not be acceded to. In such cases, it was ordered that the authority will consider the release of the convict after completion of 20 years ofimprisonment, including remissions earned. In another recent judgment in the case of Mulla and another v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2010) 3 Supreme Court Cases 508, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, while following the dictum of in the aforesaid case, held that it is open to thesentencingcourtto prescribe the length of incarceration, but that is especially true in cases where deathsentencehas been replaced bylifeimprisonment. In such cases, thecourtshould be free to determine the length ofimprisonment which will suffice the offence committed. In that case, while the deathsentencewas substituted withlifesentence, which was to extend to the fulllifeof the convicts subject to any remission by the Government for good reasons. But in the present case, the appellants were not awarded the deathsentenceby the trialcourt. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the trialcourtis not justified in prescribing the length of incarceration as 20 years. Accordingly, to that extent, the judgment of the trialcourtis liable to be modified.",

Thesentencewould enure till thelifetime of the prisoner as it is not possible to fix the period of his remaining naturallife. Asentenceofimprisonment forlifecannot be automatically treated as one for a definite period in absence of any provision to that effect in the Indian Penal Code, ' Code of Criminal Procedureor the Prisons Act. There is no rule conferring an indefeasible right on a prisonersentencedtoimprisonment forlifeto 'an unconditional release on the expiry of a particular term including remissions. The Rules under the Priosns Act do not substitute a lessersentencefor asentenceofimprisonment forlife.

In Ashok Kumar's case (supra) the Supreme Courtafter referring to the ratio of Godse's case (supra) and Maru Ram' s case (supra) held that where a person, has beensentencedtoimprisonment forlife, the remissions earned by him during his internment in prison under the relevant remission rules have a limited scope and do not acquire significance until thesentenceis remitted under Section 432 of the Code, in which case the remission would be subject to limitation of Section 433 A of the Code, unless of course power is exercised under Article 72 or 161 of the Constitution. The State Government has however, a discretion under Section 432 of the Code to remit the remaining part of thesentenceand order release of the convicted prisoner, subject to the embargo on its right imposed under Section 433 A of the Code. Such an embargo does not exist when Governor exercises power under Article 161 of the Constitution, and the limits of remission that the Governor sets in his order would not be subject to any judicial review and it would not be open for us to give an elastic meaning to the expression 'imprisonment' occurring therein more particularly when the meaning is made specific by describing it as 'actual'imprisonment.",

C.) the appellant was found guilty of multiple murders. The motive for murders was gain. The murders were perpetrated in a cruel, callous and fiendish fashion. He was awarded thesentenceof death. The Supreme Courtdeclined to interfere with thesentenceof death, though the accused was 22 years of age, and the case rested upon circumstantial evidence. The appellant filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India after his appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court. The petition for review was dismissed and the petition for clemency was also dismissed by the President of India. It was a case from Thane. The accused wassentencedto death by the Sessions Judge, Thane, on February 6, 1982, The High Courtconfirmed thesentenceof death on April 29/30, 1982. The appeal to the Supreme Courtwas dismissed on April 20, 1983 and the petition for review was dismissed on August 12, 1983. The petition for clemency was rejected by the President of India. Thereafter he filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India in the Supreme Courtpraying that in view of his tender age, his reformation in jail and the infliction of thesentenceof death on him and the delay in execution of the deathsentenceput forward by him as a ground for commuting the deathsentencebe taken into consideration and thesentencemay be commuted to one ofimprisonment forlife. The Supreme Courtcalled for the report from the prison authorities and, taking into consideration the tender age of the accused, reformation in the jail and long lapse of time since the passing of the order of ofsentenceof death, that is, of two years and nine months, quashed thesentenceof death and substituted it with thesentenceofimprisonment forlife. In T. V. Vatheeswaran v. The State of Tamil Nadu[1983] A. I. R. S. C. 361. Their Lordships of the Supreme Courtconsidered the effect of delay exceeding two years in executing thesentenceof death and laid down the law at pages 366-7 of the report thus:11. But we must hasten to add that this Courthas not taken the narrow view that the jurisdiction to interfere with a deathsentencecan be exercised only in an appeal against the judgment of conviction andsentence. The question which arises in such appeals is whether the extreme penalty provided by law is called for in the circumstances of the case. The question which arises in proceedings such as those before us is whether, even if the deathsentencewas the only appropriatesentenceto impose in the case and was therefore imposed, it will be harsh and unjust to execute thatsentenceby reason of supervening events. In very recent times, thesentenceof death has been commuted tolifeimprisonment by this Court(that is, the Supreme Courtof India) in quite a few cases for the reason, inter alia, that the prisoner was under the spectre of thesentenceof death for an unduly long time after the final confirmation of thatsentence, consequent upon the dismissal of the prisoner's Special Leave Petition or Appeal by this Court, Traditionally, subsequent events are taken into account in the area of civil law. There is no reason why they should not receive due consideration in other jurisdictions, particularly when their relevance on the implementation or execution of judicial verdicts is undeniable. Undoubtedly, principles analogous to res judicata govern all judicial proceedings but when new situations emerge, particularly factual, after a verdict has assumed finality in the course of the hierarchical process, advertence to those situations is not barred on the ground that a final decision has been rendered already. That final decision is not a decision on new facts. Courtsare never powerless to do justice, that is to say, to ensure that the processes of law do not result in undue misery, suffering or hardship. That is why, even after the final seal of approval is placed upon asentenceof death, this Courthas exercised its power to direct, ex dcbito justitiae, that though thesentencewas justified when passed, its execution, in the circumstances of the case, is not justified by reason of the unduly long time which has elapsed since the confirmation of thatsentenceby this Court. Some of us dealing with this case have been parties to decisions directing, in appropriate cases, that the deathsentenceshall not be executed by reason of supervening circumstances. 58.

As we shall be examining the evidence ourselves, and shall, in the course thereof, advert to the relevant portions of the findings of the learned A S J in the present case, we refrain from alluding to the said findings at this juncture, so as not to render this judgement over- prolix. Submissions of learned Counsel 16. Mr. Sumeet Verma, appearing on behalf of the appellant- accused, submitted that the evidence against his client, even if read as a whole, did not satisfy the well settled indicia regarding sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to bring home an offence to an accused. He submitted that there were several yawning gaps in the case set up by the prosecution, which had erroneously been overlooked by the learned A S J. Further, and without prejudice, he raised a significant contention, to the effect that this Courtwas necessarily bound, in law, to modify thesentence, awarded by the learned A S J, tolifeimprisonment per se, thereby setting aside the attendant stipulations, to the effect that the appellant would not be entitled to remission till he had served 25 years of rigorousimprisonment. Mr. Sumeet Verma emphatically submitted, in this regard, that power to award minimum mandatorylifesentenceinhered either in the Supreme Court, or in this Court, when commuting asentenceof death toimprisonment forlife, while hearing an appeal preferred against suchsentence. The twin submissions of Mr. Sumeet Verma, on this aspect of the matter, are, therefore, that (i) as the learned A S J had no power to incarcerate the appellant for any fixed term without remission, the impugned judgement, to that extent, had, in any case, to be set aside, and (ii) inasmuch as this Courtis not, presently, hearing an appeal, against a deathsentence, we, too, are powerless to award such asentence. The resultant position, Mr. Sumeet Verma would exhort us to hold, is that thesentenceawarded to his client by the impugned judgement and order had, at the very least, to be modified tolifeimprisonment simpliciter, doing away with the 25-year stipulation, as prescribed by the learned A S J, or the attendant stipulation that his client would not be entitled to remission till the expiry of such period.60. In view of the above legal position, it is clear that, while the learned A S J was empowered to award, to the appellant, thesentenceofimprisonment forlife, he did not possess the jurisdiction to caveat the said punishment with a further stipulation, to the effect that, for 25 years, the appellant would not be entitled to seek remission. In other words, as Mr. Sumeet Verma, Advocate appearing for the appellant rightly contends, the learned A S J could not have awarded the appellant a minimum mandatorysentenceof incarceration, such power being available, in law, only with this Courtor with the Supreme Court. In the present case, the learned A S J has awarded, to the appellant, thesentenceof rigorousimprisonment forlife, without any option to seek remission till he has suffered 25 years of rigorous incarceration. In view of the legal position as enunciated hereinabove, emanating from the lawlaid down bythe Supreme Court, we agree that the learned A S J could not have entered, in his order, the caveat that the appellant would not be entitled to seek remission till he had suffered 25 years of incarceration. To the said extent, therefore, the impugned order, dated 7 th April, 2015, of the learned A S J, cannot sustain, and would have to be set aside. Impugned Judgement of the learned A S J 15. As we shall be examining the evidence ourselves, and shall, in the course thereof, advert to the relevant portions of the findings of the learned A S J in the present case, we refrain from alluding to the said findings at this juncture, so as not to render this judgement over- prolix.

The Supreme Courtin the case of Sushil Murmu v. State of Jharkhandhas pointed out relevant considerations for determination ofsentence\"that the personality of the offender as revealed by his age, character, antecedents and other circumstances and traceability of the offender to reform must necessarily play the most prominent role in determining thesentence. A judge has to balance the personality of the offender with the circumstances, situations and the reactions and choose the appropriatesentenceto be imposed\". Again in the case of Devnarayan Mandal v. State of U. P. , the Supreme Courthas held that thesentenceawarded should be neither excessively harsh nor ridiculously low. The Courthas to bear in mind the principle of proportionality. The gravity of the offence, manner of commission of crime, age and' sex of the accused should be taken into account. Thus, the discretion given by the statute to the Courtfor awarding thesentencecannot be exercised arbitrarily. ( Also see : Surjitsingh v. Nahraram .

In the case of Anshad v.

For determining the propersentencewhile the Courtshould take into account the aggravating circumstances it should not overlook or ignore the mitigating circumstances. The manner in which the crime was committed, the weapons used and the brutality or the lack of it are some of the considerations which must be present to the mind of the Court. Of course, the High Courthas the power and jurisdiction to enhance thesentenceoflifeimprisonment to death but that power has to be sparingly exercised, in \"rarest of the rare cases' for ' Special reasons' to be recorded. The Courtsmust be alive to the legislative changes introduced in 1973 through Section 354(3) Cr. P. C. Deathsentence, being an exception to the general rule, should be awarded in the \"rarest of the rare cases\" for \"special reasons\" to be recorded after balancing the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances, in the facts and circumstances of a given case. The number of persons murdered is a consideration but that is not the only consideration for imposing death penalty unless the case falls in the category of \"rarest of rare cases\". The Courtsmust keep in view the nature of the crime, the brutality with which it was executed, the antecedents of the criminal, the weapons used etc. It is neither possible nor desirable to catalogue all such factors and they depend upon case to case.\"",

In this case the accused were charged with the offences of murder along with the offence under Section 148, I. P. C. Their acquittal under Section 148, I. P. C., does not necessarily mean that they were acquitted for the major offence. There is, therefore, no question of altering the finding of acquittal into one of conviction. The finding of conviction for the major offence is already there. In this view of the matter, the Privy Council authority is not applicable to the facts of the present case. Similarly, in Lakhan Mabto's (quoted supra) the accused L was specifically charged under Section 302, I. P. C. He was acquitted of that offence but was convicted under Section 302, read with Section 149, and wassentencedtoimprisonment forlife. He was also convicted under Section 326/149, I. P. C, but no separatesentencewas passed against him. Appealed against his conviction, but the Government did not file any appeal against his acquittal under Section 302, I. P. C: The High Courtin that appeal altered the conviction of L. from Section 302/149 to one under Section 326, I. P. C, maintaining thesentenceofimprisonment forlife. It was held by their Lordships of the Supreme Courtthat the High Courtacted without jurisdiction in altering the finding of acquittal of L from the charge under Section 302, I. P. C., and convicting him under Section 326, I. P. C. In exercising the powers conferred by Section 423(1)(b), Cr. P. C, which clearly confined to appeals against conviction, the High Courtcould not, in the absence of appeal by the State against the acquittal, convert the order of acquittal into one of conviction. That result could be achieved only by adopting the procedure prescribed by Section 439, Cr. P. C. This authority has clearly laid down in para No. 7 that if an order of conviction is challenged by the convicted person then it is only the order of Conviction that falls to be considereded by the appellatecourtand not the order of acquittal. In this case the accused have been convicted under Section 302 and they have challenged this conviction. We fail to appreciate the argument of learned Counsel for the appellant as to how, in the circumstances of the case, this Courtis not in a position to exercise its powers under Section 423(1)(b). Cr. P. C. Similarly because the accused have been acquitted by implication for the offence of rioting, armed with a deadly weapon, does not mean that they have also been acpuitted of the murder with which they have been charged.",
