    "text": "The State Of Rajasthan And Anr. vs Badri And Anr. on 16 July, 1974 19. Before Criminal Amendment Act No. 25 of 1955, deathsentencewas the rule for the offence ofmurderand transportation for life an exception. If the lesserpenalty was to be imposed, then Sub-section(5) of Section 367 of the Criminal Procedure Coderequired reasons to be given. By the amendment of 1955 the Parliament seems to have taken note of the current penological thought ,and had recast the provisions of the law which has done away with the requirements of giving reasons for awarding lesser punishment. The Courthas now a discretion to award either of the twopenalties prescribed under Section 302, Indian Penal Code. According to the Supreme Courtin Chawla v. State of Haryanathe deathsentenceis now exacted where themurderwas perpetrated with marked brutality. The position is reversed with the passing of the new Codeof 1973 where Section 354(3)of the Criminal Procedure Coderequires Special reasons to be given for awardingsentenceof death. This has made the deathsentenceas an exception and life imprisonment a rule. We are left in dark about the reasons for committing themurderof Mst. Somoti. Themurderhas been committed with the aid of formidable weapon which has put an end to the life of Mst. Somoti without inflicting any torture to her. In these circumstances, we cannot hold that themurderwas a brutal one which calls for the extremepenalty of death, In view of these circumstances, while maintaining the conviction of Badri under Sections 302 and 307, Indian Penal Code, we think it proper to reduce the deathpenalty to one of life imprisonment under Section 302, Indian Penal Code. Thesentenceawarded under Section 307 Indian Penal Codeis, however, maintained. The appeal of Badri is accepted to this extent.",

In the said case petitioner was convicted under Section 302 I P C on 06.03.1979 andsentencedto life imprisonment, which was confirmed by the High Courtof Punjab and Haryana.

In the said case, the Supreme Courthas overturned the conviction of the accused by the High Courtunder the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes ( Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 as the prosecution failed to prove that the offence ofrapewas committed on account of the woman belonging to the scheduled caste community undersections 3 to 5 of the Act. In that case, the Supreme Courtapplied the concept of ‘intersectionality’ after having considered that it was a relevant factor insentencingthe accused for the offence ofrapeundersection 376 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 in the light of the woman’s caste and disability.
