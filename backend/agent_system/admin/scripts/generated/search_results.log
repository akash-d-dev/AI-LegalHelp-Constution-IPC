property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property 
to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence , and takes away a book without Z's express 
consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has 
not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 
(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right

such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner, does not take or 
misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, 
if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering t he owner, or before 
he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a 
reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it. 
What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact.
