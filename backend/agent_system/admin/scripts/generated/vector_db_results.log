Illustrations 
(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z's possession, in good fa ith believingat the time when he takes it, that the 
property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property 
to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 
(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence , and takes away a book without Z's express 
consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has 
not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 
(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right 
to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sell s the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his 
own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 
Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation wi thin the 
meaning of this section. 
Illustration 
A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, 
pledges it with a banker as a security or a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this 
section. 
Explanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes 
such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner, does not take or 
misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, 
if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering t he owner, or before 
he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a 
reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it. 
What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact.

Illustrations 
(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a 
person capable by law of committing an offence, and having th e same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or 
not, is guilty of abetting an offence. 
(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under se ven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. 
B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable 
by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an 
offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. 
(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of th e unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of 
knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong o r contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's 
instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting  the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to 
the punishment provided for that offence. 
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take p roperty belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A 
induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's 
property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishon estly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of 
abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. 
Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is 
also an offence. 
Illustration 
A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and  C commits that offence in 
consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his off ence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B 
to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. 
Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspira cy that 
the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficien t if he engages in the 
conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. 
Illustration 
A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall a dminister the poison. B then explains the plan to C 
mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and 
procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in 
consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which 
Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. 
1[108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India .—A person abets an offence within the 
meaning of this Code who, in 2[India], abets the commission of any act without and beyond 2[India] 
which would constitute an offence if committed in 2[India]. 
Illustration 
A, in 2[India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] 
109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no 
express provision is made for its punishment .—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is 
committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for th e 
punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. 
Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is 
committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or w ith the aid which 
constitutes the abetment. 
Illustrations 
(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B 
accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161.

2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1 948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and  the Sch., 
to read as above.

(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the 
dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. 
(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bulloc k in a certain direction, in order that he may 
dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. 
(d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate,  dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's 
consent. A has committed theft. 
(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a wa rehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a 
goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has 
not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. 
(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occup ies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A 
dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. 
(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he 
may commit criminal misappropriation of property. 
(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not ven turing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear 
of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is hig hly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the 
intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it w hen the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the 
ring, commits theft. 
(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to h is shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for 
which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters th e shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, 
and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed crimi nal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as 
what he did was not done dishonestly.  
(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the wa tch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes 
the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z o f the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, 
inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. 
(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's poss ession without Z's consent, not having paid what he 
borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. 
(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's co nsent, with the intention of keeping it until he 
obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. 
(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence,  and takes away a book without Z's express 
consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived 
that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. 
(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and cl othes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it 
is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give aw ay alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed 
theft. 
(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A  knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such 
property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. 
(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. 
Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. 
379. Punishment for theft .—Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either 
description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. 
STATE AMENDMENT 
Gujarat.— 
In the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (XLV of 1860), after section 379, the following sections shall be

Illustrations 
(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a 
person capable by law of committing an offence, and having th e same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or 
not, is guilty of abetting an offence. 
(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under se ven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. 
B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable 
by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an 
offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. 
(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of th e unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of 
knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong o r contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's 
instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting  the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to 
the punishment provided for that offence. 
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take p roperty belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A 
induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's 
property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishon estly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of 
abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. 
Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is 
also an offence. 
Illustration

consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his off ence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B 
to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. 
Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspira cy that 
the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficien t if he engages in the 
conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. 
Illustration 
A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall a dminister the poison. B then explains the plan to C 
mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and 
procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in 
consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which 
Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.

Illustrations 
(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a 
person capable by law of committing an offence, and having th e same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or 
not, is guilty of abetting an offence. 
(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under se ven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. 
B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable 
by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an 
offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. 
(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of th e unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of 
knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong o r contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's 
instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting  the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to 
the punishment provided for that offence. 
(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take p roperty belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A 
induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's 
property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishon estly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of 
abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. 
Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is 
also an offence. 
Illustration 
A instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and  C commits that offence in 
consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his off ence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B 
to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. 
Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspira cy that 
the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficien t if he engages in the 
conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. 
Illustration 
A concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall a dminister the poison. B then explains the plan to C 
mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and 
procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in 
consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which 
Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. 
1[108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India .—A person abets an offence within the 
meaning of this Code who, in 2[India], abets the commission of any act without and beyond 2[India] 
which would constitute an offence if committed in 2[India]. 
Illustration

109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no 
express provision is made for its punishment .—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is 
committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for th e 
punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. 
Explanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is 
committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or w ith the aid which 
constitutes the abetment.
