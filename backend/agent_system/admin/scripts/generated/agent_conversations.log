1. **Right to Equality (Articles 14-18)**:
   - **Article 14**: Equality before the law and equal protection of the laws.
   - **Article 15**: Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
   - **Article 16**: Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.
   - **Article 17**: Abolition of untouchability.
   - **Article 18**: Abolition of titles, except for military and academic distinctions.

2. **Right to Freedom (Articles 19-22)**:
   - **Article 19**: Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession.
   - **Article 20**: Protection in respect of conviction for offenses (no ex post facto law, double jeopardy, and self-incrimination).

   - **Article 21A**: Right to education (free and compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14 years).
   - **Article 22**: Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases (right to be informed of grounds of arrest and to consult a legal practitioner).

3. **Right against Exploitation (Articles 23-24)**:
   - **Article 23**: Prohibition of human trafficking and forced labor.
